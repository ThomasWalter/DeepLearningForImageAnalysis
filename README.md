by [Etienne Décencière](http://cmm.ensmp.fr/~decencie/), [Santiago Velasco-Forero](http://cmm.ensmp.fr/~velasco/) and [Thomas Walter](http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~twalter/)

Deep learning has achieved formidable results in the image analysis field in recent years, in many cases exceeding human performance. This success opens paths for new applications, entrepreneurship and research, while making the field very competitive.

This course aims at providing the students with the theoretical and practical basis for understanding and using deep learning for image analysis applications.
