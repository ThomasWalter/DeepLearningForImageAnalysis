The crest lines, salient surface features defined via first- and second-order curvature derivatives, are widely used for shape matching and interrogation purposes. Their practical extraction is difficult because it requires good estimation of high-order surface derivatives. Our approach to the crest line detection is based on estimating the curvature tensor and curvature derivatives via local polynomial fitting.Since the crest lines are not defined in the surface regions where the surface focal set (caustic) degenerates, we introduce a new thresholding scheme which exploits interesting relationships between curvature extrema, the so-called MVS functional of Moreton and Sequin, and Dupin cyclides,An application of the crest lines to adaptive mesh simplification is also considered.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

Range images, which directly measure 3-D surface coordinates of a scene, are well suited for this task. In this paper we report a procedure to detect connected planar, convex, and concave surfaces of 3-D objects. This is accomplished in three stages. The first stage segments the range image into “surface patches” by a square error criterion clustering algorithm using surface points and associated surface normals. The second stage classifies these patches as planar, convex, or concave based on a non-parametric statistical test for trend, curvature values, and eigenvalue analysis. In the final stage, boundaries between adjacent surface patches are classified as crease or noncrease edges, and this information is used to merge compatible patches to produce reasonable faces of the object(s). This procedure has been successfully applied to a large number of real and synthetic images, four of which we present in this paper.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been achieving state-of-the-art performance on a variety of pattern-recognition tasks, most notably visual classification problems. Given that DNNs are now able to classify objects in images with near-human-level performance, questions naturally arise as to what differences remain between computer and human vision. A recent study [30] revealed that changing an image (e.g. of a lion) in a way imperceptible to humans can cause a DNN to label the image as something else entirely (e.g. mislabeling a lion a library). Here we show a related result: it is easy to produce images that are completely unrecognizable to humans, but that state-of-the-art DNNs believe to be recognizable objects with 99.99\% confidence (e.g. labeling with certainty that white noise static is a lion). Specifically, we take convolutional neural networks trained to perform well on either the ImageNet or MNIST datasets and then find images with evolutionary algorithms or gradient ascent that DNNs label with high confidence as belonging to each dataset class. It is possible to produce images totally unrecognizable to human eyes that DNNs believe with near certainty are familiar objects, which we call “fooling images” (more generally, fooling examples). Our results shed light on interesting differences between human vision and current DNNs, and raise questions about the generality of DNN computer vision.},

The winning team had no prior experience with EM images, and employed a convolutional network. This “deep learning” approach has since become accepted as a standard for segmentation of EM images. The challenge has continued to accept submissions, and the best so far has resulted from cooperation between two teams. The challenge has probably saturated, as algorithms cannot progress beyond limits set by ambiguities inherent in 2D scoring and the size of the test dataset. Retrospective evaluation of the challenge scoring system reveals that it was not sufficiently robust to variations in the widths of neurite borders.

In particular, skin wrinkles typically occur due to aging processes, including loss of body mass, sun damage, smoking, squinting and other factors. They represent a clear and easily accessible indicator of changes. As such, one can also acquire useful information about the aging process in skin by analyzing the wrinkles. To this end, we utilize a combination of numerical techniques, including color quantization, image segmentation, and various edge detection algorithms in order to perform automated wrinkle counting and wrinkle density calculations. As a more appropriate alternative to chronological age, such a methodology allows us to come up with quantifiable measures for skin aging, which may be used for performing statistics and extracting general patterns associated with physiological aging of the skin, as well as extending such numerical techniques for other biomedical applications in which distinct topological features contain important information about biological processes. Different subjects were used to test the techniques and extract aging patterns by examining the skin immediately underneath the lower eyelid as our region of interest. Numerically processed photographs, included counting the number of wrinkles meeting predefined threshold conditions, and calculating the corresponding wrinkle density for a given subject and particular conditions. Applicability and practicality of different edge detection methods were also a part of the studies as demonstrated.},

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

	shorttitle = {{SegNet}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00561},
	abstract = {We present a novel and practical deep fully convolutional neural network architecture for semantic pixel-wise segmentation termed SegNet. This core trainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding decoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture of the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional layers in the VGG16 network . The role of the decoder network is to map the low resolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for pixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which the decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically, the decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the corresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the need for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then convolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps. We compare our proposed architecture with the fully convolutional network (FCN) architecture and its variants. This comparison reveals the memory versus accuracy trade-off involved in achieving good segmentation performance. The design of SegNet was primarily motivated by road scene understanding applications. Hence, it is efficient both in terms of memory and computational time during inference. It is also significantly smaller in the number of trainable parameters than competing architectures and can be trained end-to-end using stochastic gradient descent. We also benchmark the performance of SegNet on Pascal VOC12 salient object segmentation and the recent SUN RGB-D indoor scene understanding challenge. We show that SegNet provides competitive performance although it is significantly smaller than other architectures. We also provide a Caffe implementation of SegNet and a webdemo at http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/},

	abstract = {The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) challenge consists of two components: (i) a publicly available dataset of images together with ground truth annotation and standardised evaluation software; and (ii) an annual competition and workshop. There are five challenges: classification, detection, segmentation, action classification, and person layout. In this paper we provide a review of the challenge from 2008–2012. The paper is intended for two audiences: algorithm designers, researchers who want to see what the state of the art is, as measured by performance on the VOC datasets, along with the limitations and weak points of the current generation of algorithms; and, challenge designers, who want to see what we as organisers have learnt from the process and our recommendations for the organisation of future challenges. To analyse the performance of submitted algorithms on the VOC datasets we introduce a number of novel evaluation methods: a bootstrapping method for determining whether differences in the performance of two algorithms are significant or not; a normalised average precision so that performance can be compared across classes with different proportions of positive instances; a clustering method for visualising the performance across multiple algorithms so that the hard and easy images can be identified; and the use of a joint classifier over the submitted algorithms in order to measure their complementarity and combined performance. We also analyse the community’s progress through time using the methods of Hoiem et al. (Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision, 2012) to identify the types of occurring errors. We conclude the paper with an appraisal of the aspects of the challenge that worked well, and those that could be improved in future challenges.},

	abstract = {A neural network model for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition is proposed in this paper. The network is self-organized by “learning without a teacher”, and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname “neocognitron”. After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of “S-cells”, which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of “C-cells” similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any “teacher” during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that convolutional networks can achieve a great deal of success in high-level vision problems such as objection recognition. In this paper, convolutional networks are used to solve a typical low-level image processing task, image segmentation. Here, the convolutional networks are trained using gradient descent techniques to solve the problem of segmenting the cell nuclei from the background in the histopathology images. Using a dataset with 58 H\&E stained breast cancer biopsy images, we find that the convolutional networks, with 3 hidden layers and 8 feature maps per hidden layer, provide superior performance to other pixel classification methods including FLDA and SVM. We also show two important properties of the convolutional networks as a segmentation method. First, as a machine learning approach, the convolution networks encode enough high-level domain-specific knowledge into the final segmentation strategy by learning the training data. Second, the convolutional networks can use appropriate amount of context information in segmenting by optimizing the weights of the filters in the networks through the learning process. In the end of this paper, several possible directions for future research are also proposed.},

Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. The method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without tricks, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition. Code will be made available.},

This requirement makes it expensive to annotate new categories and has restricted instance segmentation models to {\textasciitilde}100 well-annotated classes. The goal of this paper is to propose a new partially supervised training paradigm, together with a novel weight transfer function, that enables training instance segmentation models over a large set of categories for which all have box annotations, but only a small fraction have mask annotations. These contributions allow us to train Mask R-CNN to detect and segment 3000 visual concepts using box annotations from the Visual Genome dataset and mask annotations from the 80 classes in the COCO dataset. We carefully evaluate our proposed approach in a controlled study on the COCO dataset. This work is a first step towards instance segmentation models that have broad comprehension of the visual world.},

	abstract = {We introduce YOLO9000, a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect over 9000 object categories. First we propose various improvements to the YOLO detection method, both novel and drawn from prior work. The improved model, YOLOv2, is state-of-the-art on standard detection tasks like PASCAL VOC and COCO. At 67 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 76.8 mAP on VOC 2007. At 40 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 78.6 mAP, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Faster RCNN with ResNet and SSD while still running significantly faster. Finally we propose a method to jointly train on object detection and classification. Using this method we train YOLO9000 simultaneously on the COCO detection dataset and the ImageNet classification dataset. Our joint training allows YOLO9000 to predict detections for object classes that don't have labelled detection data. We validate our approach on the ImageNet detection task. YOLO9000 gets 19.7 mAP on the ImageNet detection validation set despite only having detection data for 44 of the 200 classes. On the 156 classes not in COCO, YOLO9000 gets 16.0 mAP. But YOLO can detect more than just 200 classes; it predicts detections for more than 9000 different object categories. And it still runs in real-time.},

	doi = {10.1007/978-3-319-46448-0_2},
	abstract = {We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. Our SSD model is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stage and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has comparable accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy, even with a smaller input image size. For \$300{\textbackslash}times 300\$ input, SSD achieves 72.1\% mAP on VOC2007 test at 58 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for \$500{\textbackslash}times 500\$ input, SSD achieves 75.1\% mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model.

Models are typically based on large amounts of data with annotated examples of known markers aiming at automating detection. High annotation effort and the limitation to a vocabulary of known markers limit the power of such approaches. Here, we perform unsupervised learning to identify anomalies in imaging data as candidates for markers. We propose AnoGAN, a deep convolutional generative adversarial network to learn a manifold of normal anatomical variability, accompanying a novel anomaly scoring scheme based on the mapping from image space to a latent space. Applied to new data, the model labels anomalies, and scores image patches indicating their fit into the learned distribution. Results on optical coherence tomography images of the retina demonstrate that the approach correctly identifies anomalous images, such as images containing retinal fluid or hyperreflective foci.},

They explore all paths from a defined class, and filter them with a length criterion. However, most paths are redundant, making the process generally slow. Parsimonious path openings and closings are introduced in this paper to solve this problem. These operators only consider a subset of the paths considered by classical path openings, thus achieving a substantial speed-up, while obtaining similar results. In addition, a recently introduced 1D opening algorithm is applied along each selected path. Its complexity is linear with respect to the number of pixels, independent of the size of the opening. Furthermore, it is fast for any input data accuracy (integer or floating point) and works in stream. Parsimonious path openings are also extended to incomplete paths, i.e., paths containing gaps. Noise-corrupted paths can thus be processed with the same approach and complexity. These parsimonious operators achieve a several orders of magnitude speed-up. Examples are shown for incomplete path openings, where computing times are brought from minutes to tens of milliseconds, while obtaining similar results.},

It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

The challenge of detecting neutrophils in presence of nucleated cells is solved using the recent advances of deep learning algorithms. Separation of SC layer, extraction of patches from the layer followed by classification of patches with respect to presence or absence of neutrophils form the basis of the overall approach which is effected through an integration of a U-Net based segmentation network and a capsule network for classification. The novel design of the present capsule net leads to a drastic reduction in the number of parameters without any noticeable compromise in the overall performance. The research further addresses the challenge of dealing with Mega-pixel images (in 10X) vis-à-vis Giga-pixel ones (in 40X). The promising result coming out of an experiment on a dataset consisting of 273 real-life images shows that a practical system is possible based on the present research.

First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on our PReLU networks (PReLU-nets), we achieve 4.94\% top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26\% relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66\%). To our knowledge, our result is the first to surpass human-level performance (5.1\%, Russakovsky et al.) on this visual recognition challenge.},

	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are well known for producing state-of-the-art recognizers for document processing [1]. However, they can be difficult to implement and are usually slower than traditional multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We present three novel approaches to speeding up CNNs: a) unrolling convolution, b) using BLAS (basic linear algebra subroutines), and c) using GPUs (graphic processing units). Unrolled convolution converts the processing in each convolutional layer (both forward-propagation and back-propagation) into a matrix-matrix product. The matrix-matrix product representation of CNNs makes their implementation as easy as MLPs. BLAS is used to efficiently compute matrix products on the CPU. We also present a pixel shader based GPU implementation of CNNs. Results on character recognition problems indicate that unrolled convolution with BLAS produces a dramatic 2.4X−3.0X speedup. The GPU implementation is even faster and produces a 3.1X−4.1X speedup.},

This was achieved by a carefully crafted design that allows for increasing the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing.

	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.},
