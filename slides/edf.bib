The problem has applications in telecommunication (where it is desirable to disperse the transceivers in order to minimize interference problems), and in location of shops and service-stations (where the mutual competition should be minimized).A number of fast upper bounds are presented based on Lagrangian relaxation, semidefinite programming and reformulation techniques. A branch-and-bound algorithm is then derived, which at each branching node is able to compute the reformulation-based upper bound in O(n) time. Computational experiments show that the algorithm may solve geometric problems of size up to n = 90, and weighted geometric problems of size n = 250.The related p-dispersion problem is the problem of locating p facilities such that the minimum distance between two facilities is as large as possible. New formulations and fast upper bounds are presented, and it is discussed whether a similar framework as for the p-dispersion sum problem can be used to tighten the upper bounds. A solution algorithm based on transformation of the p-dispersion problem to the p-dispersion-sum problem is finally presented, and its performance is evaluated through several computational experiments.},

We introduce a new dataset of fundus images from various ethnic groups and levels of DME which we have made publicly available.

We then introduce a new superpixel algorithm, simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC), which adapts a k-means clustering approach to efficiently generate superpixels. Despite its simplicity, SLIC adheres to boundaries as well as or better than previous methods. At the same time, it is faster and more memory efficient, improves segmentation performance, and is straightforward to extend to supervoxel generation.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces the problem of combining multiple partitionings of a set of objects into a single consolidated clustering without accessing the features or algorithms that determined these partitionings. We first identify several application scenarios for the resultant 'knowledge reuse' framework that we call cluster ensembles. The cluster ensemble problem is then formalized as a combinatorial optimization problem in terms of shared mutual information. In addition to a direct maximization approach, we propose three effective and efficient techniques for obtaining high-quality combiners (consensus functions). The first combiner induces a similarity measure from the partitionings and then reclusters the objects. The second combiner is based on hypergraph partitioning. The third one collapses groups of clusters into meta-clusters which then compete for each object to determine the combined clustering. Due to the low computational costs of our techniques, it is quite feasible to use a supra-consensus function that evaluates all three approaches against the objective function and picks the best solution for a given situation. We evaluate the effectiveness of cluster ensembles in three qualitatively different application scenarios: (i) where the original clusters were formed based on non-identical sets of features, (ii) where the original clustering algorithms worked on non-identical sets of objects, and (iii) where a common data-set is used and the main purpose of combining multiple clusterings is to improve the quality and robustness of the solution. Promising results are obtained in all three situations for synthetic as well as real data-sets.},

	abstract = {Cluster ensembles have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to standard cluster analysis, aggregating several input data clusterings to generate a single output clustering, with improved robustness and stability. From the early work, these techniques held great promise; however, most of them generate the final solution based on incomplete information of a cluster ensemble. The underlying ensemble-information matrix reflects only cluster-data point relations, while those among clusters are generally overlooked. This paper presents a new link-based approach to improve the conventional matrix. It achieves this using the similarity between clusters that are estimated from a link network model of the ensemble. In particular, three new link-based algorithms are proposed for the underlying similarity assessment. The final clustering result is generated from the refined matrix using two different consensus functions of feature-based and graph-based partitioning. This approach is the first to address and explicitly employ the relationship between input partitions, which has not been emphasized by recent studies of matrix refinement. The effectiveness of the link-based approach is empirically demonstrated over 10 data sets (synthetic and real) and three benchmark evaluation measures. The results suggest the new approach is able to efficiently extract information embedded in the input clusterings, and regularly illustrate higher clustering quality in comparison to several state-of-the-art techniques.},

We observed a negative relationship between the SAAID and age, which was accelerated for the female (n=7) subgroup. The current findings are the first in vivo demonstration of this relationship, and they show that specific characteristics of aged skin such as the ratio of extracellular matrix components collagen and elastin can be evaluated by in vivo AF and SHG measurements using near-IR femtosecond laser pulses.},

These operators have been applied to images in different color spaces and compared with other kinds of ASEs extended to color images. Results show that the proposed method is more respectful with the borders of the objects, as well as with the color transitions within the image. Finally, the proposed adaptive morphological operators are applied to the classification of color texture images.},

Here, we provide a scheme for applying the watershed transform for superpixel generation, where we use a spatially regularized gradient to achieve a tunable trade-off between superpixel regularity and adherence to object boundaries. We quantitatively evaluate our method on the Berkeley segmentation database and show that we achieve comparable results to a previously published state-of-the art algorithm, while avoiding some of the arbitrary postprocessing steps the latter requires.},

	abstract = {The p-dispersion-sum problem is the problem of locating p facilities at some of n predefined locations, such that the distance sum between the p facilities is maximized. The problem has applications in telecommunication (where it is desirable to disperse the transceivers in order to minimize interference problems), and in location of shops and service-stations (where the mutual competition should be minimized).
A number of fast upper bounds are presented based on Lagrangian relaxation, semidefinite programming and reformulation techniques. A branch-and-bound algorithm is then derived, which at each branching node is able to compute the reformulation-based upper bound in O(n)O(n) time. Computational experiments show that the algorithm may solve geometric problems of size up to n=90n=90, and weighted geometric problems of size n=250n=250.
The related p-dispersion problem is the problem of locating p facilities such that the minimum distance between two facilities is as large as possible. New formulations and fast upper bounds are presented, and it is discussed whether a similar framework as for the p-dispersion sum problem can be used to tighten the upper bounds. A solution algorithm based on transformation of the p-dispersion problem to the p-dispersion-sum problem is finally presented, and its performance is evaluated through several computational experiments.},

A high-quality estimation of high-order surface derivatives is achieved by combining multi-level implicit surface fitting and finite difference approximations. We demonstrate that the ridges and valleys are geometrically and perceptually salient surface features, and, therefore, can be potentially used for shape recognition, coding, and quality evaluation purposes.},

The fundamental process for each of these algorithms is to use the image content to generate a set of weights for the graph and then set conditions for an optimal partition of the graph with respect to these weights. To date, the heuristics used for generating the weighted graphs from image intensities have largely been ignored, while the primary focus of attention has been on the details of providing the partitioning conditions. In this paper we empirically study the effects of graph connectivity and weighting function on the quality of the segmentation results. To control for algorithm-specific effects, we employ both the Graph Cuts and Random Walker algorithms in our experiments.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Accurate and efficient automatic or semi-automatic brain image segmentation methods are of great interest to both scientific and clinical researchers of the human central neural system. Cerebral white matter segmentation in brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data becomes a challenging problem due to a combination of several factors like low contrast, presence of noise and imaging artifacts, partial volume effects, intrinsic tissue variation due to neurodevelopment and neuropathologies, and the highly convoluted geometry of the cortex. In this paper, we propose a new set of edge weights for the traditional graph cut algorithm (Boykov and Jolly, 2001) to correctly segment the cerebral white matter from T1-weighted MRI sequence. In this algorithm, the edge weights of Boykov and Jolly (2001) are modified by comparing the probabilities of an individual voxel and its neighboring voxels to belong to different segmentation classes. A shape prior in form of a series of ellipses is used next to model the contours of the human skull in various 2D slices in the sequence. This shape constraint is imposed to prune the original graph constructed from the input to form a subgraph consisting of voxels within the skull contours. Our graph cut algorithm with new set of edge weights is applied to the above subgraph, thereby increasing the segmentation accuracy as well as decreasing the computation time. Average segmentation errors for the proposed algorithm, the graph cut algorithm (Boykov and Jolly, 2001), and the Expectation Maximization Segmentation (EMS) algorithm Van Leemput et al., 2001 in terms of Dice coefficients are found to be (3.72 ± 1.12)\%, (14.88 ± 1.69)\%, and (11.95 ± 5.2)\%, respectively.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The recent booming of multiphoton imaging of collagen fibrils by means of second harmonic generation microscopy generates the need for the development and automation of quantitative methods for image analysis. Standard approaches sequentially analyse two-dimensional (2D) slices to gain knowledge on the spatial arrangement and dimension of the fibrils, whereas the reconstructed three-dimensional (3D) image yields better information about these characteristics. In this work, a 3D analysis method is proposed for second harmonic generation images of collagen fibrils, based on a recently developed 3D fibre quantification method. This analysis uses operators from mathematical morphology. The fibril structure is scanned with a directional distance transform. Inertia moments of the directional distances yield the main fibre orientation, corresponding to the main inertia axis. The collaboration of directional distances and fibre orientation delivers a geometrical estimate of the fibre radius. The results include local maps as well as global distribution of orientation and radius of the fibrils over the 3D image. They also bring a segmentation of the image into foreground and background, as well as a classification of the foreground pixels into the preferred orientations. This accurate determination of the spatial arrangement of the fibrils within a 3D data set will be most relevant in biomedical applications. It brings the possibility to monitor remodelling of collagen tissues upon a variety of injuries and to guide tissues engineering because biomimetic 3D organizations and density are requested for better integration of implants.},

	abstract = {Aims
This study aimed to evaluate automated fundus photograph analysis algorithms for the detection of primary lesions and a computer-assisted diagnostic system for grading diabetic retinopathy (DR) and the risk of macular edema (ME).
Methods
Two prospective analyses were conducted on fundus images from diabetic patients. Automated detection of microaneurysms and exudates was applied to two small image databases on which these lesions were manually marked. A computer-assisted diagnostic system for the detection and grading of DR and the risk of ME was then developed and evaluated, using a large database containing both normal and pathological images, and compared with manual grading.
Results
The algorithm for the automated detection of microaneurysms demonstrated a sensitivity of 88.5\%, with an average number of 2.13 false positives per image. The pixel-based evaluation of the algorithm for automated detection of exudates had a sensitivity of 92.8\% and a positive predictive value of 92.4\%. Combined automated grading of DR and risk of ME was performed on 761 images from a large database. For DR detection, the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm were 83.9\% and 72.7\%, respectively, and, for detection of the risk of ME, the sensitivity and specificity were 72.8\% and 70.8\%, respectively.
Conclusion
This study shows that previously published algorithms for computer-aided diagnosis is a reliable alternative to time-consuming manual analysis of fundus photographs when screening for DR. The use of this system would allow considerable timesavings for physicians and, therefore, alleviate the time spent on a mass-screening programme.},

	abstract = {Aims
There is a need for evaluation of screening and grading services for diabetic retinopathy (DR) in compliance with quality-assurance (QA) standards. We describe the screening/grading QA programme set up for OPHDIAT© over the 2005–2006 period.
Methods
Screening and grading objectives, evaluation criteria and minimum acceptable QA standards were set. To ensure the quality of DR photos, the proportion of nongradable photos in at least one eye had to be less than 10\%. To ensure grading accuracy, intergrading agreement had to be greater than 90\%. Grader-generated reports had to be available in less than 48 h for more than 80\% photos. Readers had to grade 500 to 3000 photos per year.
Results
Sixteen screening centres were opened between June 2004 and December 2006, and 14,769 patients were screened. Percentages of nongradable photos were consistently below the QA requirement (less than 10\%). Overall, 800 photos were graded a second time by a reader blinded to original grading; agreement between graders ranged from 92 to 99\%. More than 90\% of grader-generated reports were produced within 48 h. The number of readings by each grader nearly achieved the QA standard.
Conclusion
QA for DR telescreening should be a continuous process to provide performance feedback, thus guaranteeing a high standard for delivered results. Almost all of the predetermined QA standards in OPHDIAT© for screening and grading were met. Besides the quality/sensitivity of the screening/grading modalities, it is important to evaluate at-risk patients so that they can be treated efficiently; this should be addressed in a global QA programme.},

Productive computer-based screening of large, at-risk populations at low cost requires robust, automated image analysis. In this paper we present results for the automatic detection of the optic nerve and localization of the macula using digital red-free fundus photography. Our method relies on the accurate segmentation of the vasculature of the retina followed by the determination of spatial features describing the density, average thickness, and average orientation of the vasculature in relation to the position of the optic nerve. Localization of the macula follows using knowledge of the optic nerve location to detect the horizontal raphe of the retina using a geometric model of the vasculature. We report 90.4\% detection performance for the optic nerve and 92.5\% localization performance for the macula for red-free fundus images representing a population of 345 images corresponding to 269 patients with 18 different pathologies associated with DR and other common retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration.},

We then introduce a new superpixel algorithm, simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC), which adapts a k-means clustering approach to efficiently generate superpixels. Despite its simplicity, SLIC adheres to boundaries as well as or better than previous methods. At the same time, it is faster and more memory efficient, improves segmentation performance, and is straightforward to extend to supervoxel generation.},

In this paper, we describe the structure-sensitive superpixel technique by exploiting Lloyd’s algorithm with the geodesic distance. Our method generates smaller superpixels to achieve relatively low under-segmentation in structure-dense regions with high intensity or color variation, and produces larger segments to increase computational efficiency in structure-sparse regions with homogeneous appearance. We adopt geometric flows to compute geodesic distances amongst pixels. In the segmentation procedure, the density of over-segments is automatically adjusted through iteratively optimizing an energy functional that embeds color homogeneity, structure density. Comparative experiments with the Berkeley database show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the prior arts while offering a comparable computational efficiency as TurboPixels. Further applications in image compression, object closure extraction and video segmentation demonstrate the effective extensions of our approach.},

The algorithm can be divided into four steps. The first step consists in image enhancement, shade correction and image normalization of the green channel. The second step aims at detecting candidates, i.e. all patterns possibly corresponding to MA, which is achieved by diameter closing and an automatic threshold scheme. Then, features are extracted, which are used in the last step to automatically classify candidates into real MA and other objects; the classification relies on kernel density estimation with variable bandwidth. A database of 21 annotated images has been used to train the algorithm. The algorithm was compared to manually obtained gradings of 94 images; sensitivity was 88.5\% at an average number of 2.13 false positives per image.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Among gynecologic cancers, ovarian cancer is the second most common and has the highest mortality. Currently, there is no accurate early diagnostic technique for ovarian cancer. Furthermore, little is understood regarding the early progression of this disease. We have imaged multiphoton interactions of endogenous tissue constituents from normal and abnormal ovarian biopsies that were kept viable during transport from the operating room and microscopy.
Experimental Design: The ovarian surface and underlying stroma were assessed with two-photon excited fluorescence (2PEF) and second harmonic generation (SHG). High-resolution, optically sectioned images were analyzed for epithelial morphology based on 2PEF and collagen density and structural integrity based on SHG. Additionally, multiwavelength 2PEF provided an estimation of the cellular redox ratio of epithelial cells.
Results: Normal tissue exhibited a uniform epithelial layer with highly structured collagen in the stroma, whereas abnormal tissue exhibited varied epithelium with large cells and substantial quantitative changes to the collagen structure. Samples from patients at high risk for developing ovarian cancer (based on their personal/family history of cancer) exhibited highly variable cellular redox ratios and changes in collagen structure that trended toward cancer samples.
Conclusion: This study highlights differences in endogenous signals in viable ovarian biopsies based on quantitative collagen structural changes and redox ratio estimates that may lead to improved detection and further insights in ovarian cancer, particularly in the early stages of the disease.

	abstract = {The recent booming of multiphoton imaging of collagen fibrils by means of second harmonic generation microscopy generates the need for the development and automation of quantitative methods for image analysis. Standard approaches sequentially analyse two-dimensional (2D) slices to gain knowledge on the spatial arrangement and dimension of the fibrils, whereas the reconstructed three-dimensional (3D) image yields better information about these characteristics. In this work, a 3D analysis method is proposed for second harmonic generation images of collagen fibrils, based on a recently developed 3D fibre quantification method. This analysis uses operators from mathematical morphology. The fibril structure is scanned with a directional distance transform. Inertia moments of the directional distances yield the main fibre orientation, corresponding to the main inertia axis. The collaboration of directional distances and fibre orientation delivers a geometrical estimate of the fibre radius. The results include local maps as well as global distribution of orientation and radius of the fibrils over the 3D image. They also bring a segmentation of the image into foreground and background, as well as a classification of the foreground pixels into the preferred orientations. This accurate determination of the spatial arrangement of the fibrils within a 3D data set will be most relevant in biomedical applications. It brings the possibility to monitor remodelling of collagen tissues upon a variety of injuries and to guide tissues engineering because biomimetic 3D organizations and density are requested for better integration of implants.},

                  The diagnostic accuracy of computer detection programs has been reported to be comparable to that of specialists and expert readers, but no computer detection programs have been validated in an independent cohort using an internationally recognized diabetic retinopathy (DR) standard.Objective 
                  To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Iowa Detection Program (IDP) to detect referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR).Design and Setting 
                  In primary care DR clinics in France, from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2010, patients were photographed consecutively, and retinal color images were graded for retinopathy severity according to the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy scale and macular edema by 3 masked independent retinal specialists and regraded with adjudication until consensus. The IDP analyzed the same images at a predetermined and fixed set point. We defined RDR as more than mild nonproliferative retinopathy and/or macular edema.Participants 
                  A total of 874 people with diabetes at risk for DR.Main Outcome Measures 
                  Sensitivity and specificity of the IDP to detect RDR, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity and specificity of the retinal specialists' readings, and mean interobserver difference (κ).Results 
                  The RDR prevalence was 21.7\% (95\% CI, 19.0\%-24.5\%). The IDP sensitivity was 96.8\% (95\% CI, 94.4\%-99.3\%) and specificity was 59.4\% (95\% CI, 55.7\%-63.0\%), corresponding to 6 of 874 false-negative results (none met treatment criteria). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.937 (95\% CI, 0.916-0.959). Before adjudication and consensus, the sensitivity/specificity of the retinal specialists were 0.80/0.98, 0.71/1.00, and 0.91/0.95, and the mean intergrader κ was 0.822.Conclusions 
                  The IDP has high sensitivity and specificity to detect RDR. Computer analysis of retinal photographs for DR and automated detection of RDR can be implemented safely into the DR screening pipeline, potentially improving access to screening and health care productivity and reducing visual loss through early treatment.},

	abstract = {Background Despite the obvious relation between smoking and facial wrinkling, grossly undetectable wrinkling and the consequences of smoking on the face have been poorly studied. Objective To assess the risk factor of cigarette smoking on the development of premature facial wrinkling. Methods One hundred and twenty-three nonsmokers, 160 current smokers, and 67 past smokers, aged 20–69 years, were studied. Cigarette smoking status, weight changes, average sun exposure time (recreational and occupational) in 1 month, and past medical and facial cosmetic surgery were quantified by self-questionnaire. Computerized image analysis of silicone skin replicas was used in addition to clinical visual measurement, and a severity score based on predetermined criteria was assigned to each patient. Results Current smokers have a higher degree of facial wrinkling than nonsmokers and past smokers. Past smokers who smoked heavily at a younger age show less facial wrinkling than current smokers. In the analysis, which was adjusted for age group, the relative risk of moderate to severe wrinkling for current smokers compared with nonsmokers was 2.72 (confidence interval, CI: 1.32–3.21, P {\textless} 0.05). In current smokers, the relative risks associated with more than 19 pack-years and 11–19 pack-years of smoking compared with nonsmokers were 2.93 (CI: 1.14–4.1, P {\textless} 0.05) and 1.75 (CI: 1.54–3.67, P {\textless} 0.05), respectively. On image analysis of facial skin replicas, the mean values of Ra (arithmetic average roughness), Rz (average roughness), and Rt (distance between the highest and lowest values) of current smokers were higher than those of nonsmokers and past smokers in all age groups. This indicates a strong correlation between cigarette smoking and skin wrinkling. In addition, microscopic superficial wrinkling (Ra and Rt) was noted in current smokers in the younger age group (20–39 years). Conclusions This study suggests that attention should be paid to smoking-associated facial wrinkling (not evident from a visual assessment) in young people and added to the list of disorders seemingly caused by smoking.},

The crest lines, salient surface features defined via first- and second-order curvature derivatives, are widely used for shape matching and interrogation purposes. Their practical extraction is difficult because it requires good estimation of high-order surface derivatives. Our approach to the crest line detection is based on estimating the curvature tensor and curvature derivatives via local polynomial fitting.Since the crest lines are not defined in the surface regions where the surface focal set (caustic) degenerates, we introduce a new thresholding scheme which exploits interesting relationships between curvature extrema, the so-called MVS functional of Moreton and Sequin, and Dupin cyclides,An application of the crest lines to adaptive mesh simplification is also considered.},

	abstract = {Evaluation of object detection algorithms is a non-trivial task: a detection result is usually evaluated by comparing the bounding box of the detected object with the bounding box of the ground truth object. The commonly used precision and recall measures are computed from the overlap area of these two rectangles. However, these measures have several drawbacks: they don't give intuitive information about the proportion of the correctly detected objects and the number of false alarms, and they cannot be accumulated across multiple images without creating ambiguity in their interpretation. Furthermore, quantitative and qualitative evaluation is often mixed resulting in ambiguous measures. In this paper we propose a new approach which tackles these problems. The performance of a detection algorithm is illustrated intuitively by performance graphs which present object level precision and recall depending on constraints on detection quality. In order to compare different detection algorithms, a representative single performance value is computed from the graphs. The influence of the test database on the detection performance is illustrated by performance/generality graphs. The evaluation method can be applied to different types of object detection algorithms. It has been tested on different text detection algorithms, among which are the participants of the ICDAR 2003 text detection competition.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS

The confocal laser scanning microscope Vivascope (Lucid, Henrietta) allows skin to be studied in real-time with a resolution of 0.5 microm horizontal and 1.3 microm vertical in vivo. In this study, we present the results of a comparison between the skin of an older and a younger group of volunteers by in vivo histometric measurements.


METHODS

To investigate changes caused by age, 13 young (18-25years) and 13 older ({\textgreater}65years) volunteers were examined. The following parameters were measured using the Vivascope at the volar forearm: minimal thickness of the epidermis (E(min)), size of cells in the granular layer (A(gran)), thickness of the horny layer (DSC), thickness of the basal layer (DSB) and number of dermal papillae per area (Papl). The image analysis program image tool was used to measure the size of the cells and the thickness of the basal layer.


RESULTS

The older group of volunteers showed a significant increase in E(min), no significant change in DSC, a significant decrease in dermal papillae and in the thickness of the basal layer, and an increase in A(gran) compared to the younger group.


CONCLUSIONS

Histometric measurements by in vivo confocal laser scanning microscopy are a sensitive and non-invasive tool for characterizing and quantifying histological changes of the epidermis and papillary dermis due to ageing.},

	abstract = {Computer-aided segmentation of anatomical structures in medical images is a valuable tool for efficient radiation therapy planning (RTP). As delineation errors highly affect the radiation oncology treatment, it is crucial to delineate geometric structures accurately. In this paper, a semi-automatic segmentation approach for computed tomography (CT) images, based on watershed and graph-cuts methods, is presented. The watershed pre-segmentation groups small areas of similar intensities in homogeneous labels, which are subsequently used as input for the graph-cuts algorithm. This methodology does not require of prior knowledge of the structure to be segmented; even so, it performs well with complex shapes and low intensity. The presented method also allows the user to add foreground and background strokes in any of the three standard orthogonal views – axial, sagittal or coronal - making the interaction with the algorithm easy and fast. Hence, the segmentation information is propagated within the whole volume, providing a spatially coherent result. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated using 9 CT volumes, by comparing its segmentation performance over several organs - lungs, liver, spleen, heart and aorta - to those of manual delineation from experts. A Dice´s coefficient higher than 0.89 was achieved in every case. That demonstrates that the proposed approach works well for all the anatomical structures analyzed. Due to the quality of the results, the introduction of the proposed approach in the RTP process will be a helpful tool for organs at risk (OARs) segmentation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Skin aging is accelerated by extrinsic factors, particularly actinic damage. Over the last decades, both clinical and pathological differences between intrinsic and actinic aging have been characterized. In this work, we aimed at quantifying skin aging by non-invasive in vivo methods.


METHODS

Young healthy volunteers using indoor tanning facilities and aged people were compared with appropriate controls by measurements of skin elasticity with the Cutometer and the Reviscometer and by semi-quantitative evaluation of the dermal matrix composition by the multiphoton laser tomograph DermaInspect.


RESULTS

We found differences between the sun-protected volar forearm and the dorsal side as well as between young and old test persons with all three methods. No significant differences were found between the skin of indoor-tanned test persons and control. Also, gender had no influence on the severity of skin aging.


CONCLUSION

The most consistent results were obtained with the DermaInspect. The considerable inter-individual variation due to the cross-sectional design of the study may have disguised the factual skin damage caused by tanning beds.},

The algorithm requires only one scan of the signal, runs in place in O(1) per pixel, and supports any scalar data precision (integer or floating-point data). The algorithm is applied to two-dimensional images along straight lines, in arbitrary orientations. Oriented size distributions can thus be efficiently computed, and textures characterised. Extensive benchmarks are reported. They show that the proposed algorithm allows computing 1-D openings faster than existing algorithms for data precisions higher than 8 bits, and remains competitive with respect to the algorithm proposed by Van Droogenbroeck when dealing with 8-bit images. When computing granulometries, the new algorithm runs faster than any other method of the state of the art. Moreover, it allows efficient computation of 1-D component trees.},

We consider the question of obtaining near-optimal solutions. for MAX-MIN, we show that if the distances do not satisfy the triangle inequality, there is no polynomial-time relative approximation algorithm unless P = NP. When the distances satisfy the triangle inequality, we analyze an efficient heuristic and show that it provides a performance guarantee of two.

	abstract = {Evaluation of object detection algorithms is a non-trivial task: a detection result is usually evaluated by comparing the bounding box of the detected object with the bounding box of the ground truth object. The commonly used precision and recall measures are computed from the overlap area of these two rectangles. However, these measures have several drawbacks: they don't give intuitive information about the proportion of the correctly detected objects and the number of false alarms, and they cannot be accumulated across multiple images without creating ambiguity in their interpretation. Furthermore, quantitative and qualitative evaluation is often mixed resulting in ambiguous measures. In this paper we propose a new approach which tackles these problems. The performance of a detection algorithm is illustrated intuitively by performance graphs which present object level precision and recall depending on constraints on detection quality. In order to compare different detection algorithms, a representative single performance value is computed from the graphs. The influence of the test database on the detection performance is illustrated by performance/generality graphs. The evaluation method can be applied to different types of object detection algorithms. It has been tested on different text detection algorithms, among which are the participants of the ICDAR 2003 text detection competition.},

	abstract = {In this study, the authors propose a novel algorithm for background??foreground segmentation. The work is motivated by the need for information about the background that is obscured by objects, in order to achieve accurate segmentation. The algorithm utilises the principle of estimating the occluded background by surface fitting. Edge detection methods are used to detect boundaries between foreground and background, identifying background points as well as foreground points. This categorisation will guarantee that most points used for surface fitting are from the same category and thus the proposed surface fitting with random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm will produce an accurate estimate of the surface. The authors algorithm has been applied to the real-world applications of segmenting plant images with inhomogeneous but smooth background and measuring the relative temperature of plants. Comparisons with experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is able to reduce significantly background inhomogeneities in infra-red images for the accurate estimation of temperature differences between background and plants, which provides important clues for fast and cheap genetic screening. The proposed algorithm is also able to overcome the intensity inhomogeneities for accurate image segmentation, particularly for plant root image segmentation with the preservation of lateral plant roots.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Among gynecologic cancers, ovarian cancer is the second most common and has the highest mortality. Currently, there is no accurate early diagnostic technique for ovarian cancer. Furthermore, little is understood regarding the early progression of this disease. We have imaged multiphoton interactions of endogenous tissue constituents from normal and abnormal ovarian biopsies that were kept viable during transport from the operating room and microscopy. Experimental Design: The ovarian surface and underlying stroma were assessed with two-photon excited fluorescence (2PEF) and second harmonic generation (SHG). High-resolution, optically sectioned images were analyzed for epithelial morphology based on 2PEF and collagen density and structural integrity based on SHG. Additionally, multiwavelength 2PEF provided an estimation of the cellular redox ratio of epithelial cells.
RESULTS: Normal tissue exhibited a uniform epithelial layer with highly structured collagen in the stroma, whereas abnormal tissue exhibited varied epithelium with large cells and substantial quantitative changes to the collagen structure. Samples from patients at high risk for developing ovarian cancer (based on their personal/family history of cancer) exhibited highly variable cellular redox ratios and changes in collagen structure that trended toward cancer samples.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights differences in endogenous signals in viable ovarian biopsies based on quantitative collagen structural changes and redox ratio estimates that may lead to improved detection and further insights in ovarian cancer, particularly in the early stages of the disease.},

	abstract = {The aims of the study were to write an image analysis (IA) program allowing the stereological quantification of human epidermal melanocyte melanization at the ultrastructural level and to specify the suitable preparative methods, in keeping with IA limits and stereological principles. Micrographs of cultured human melanocytes obtained in transmission electron microscopy were digitized with a scanner. The key step of the designed IA program is a thresholding based on the gray levels. Hence, gray level histograms (pixel frequency as a function of gray level) of melanocyte images exhibit a peak specific to melanin. The gray level thresholding used consists in isolating the melanin pixels that form profiles on a binary image and in storing the numerical data produced for a given melanocyte profile. These primary data are used to calculate numerous parameters via stereology with melanocyte cytoplasm and melanized melanosome as main reference spaces. The most important stereological parameters obtained are v (mi,cy) (melanin volume per average cell), v (mi,m) (melanin volume per average melanized melanosome), and n m (number of melanized melanosomes per average cell), and their validity is discussed. Melanocytes embedded in situ were abandoned for stereological reasons but pelleted melanocytes were found suitable. Using this computerized tool and stereology, we are able to perform quantitative studies producing varied data even from small cell samples. To our knowledge, this is the first stereological approach for quantifying intracellular melanization. A quantitative comparison of spectrophotometrical results (melanin assay) with stereological results obtained in ultraviolet B-irradiated Caucasian epidermal melanocytes will be performed in order to appraise this method.

	abstract = {In this study, the authors propose a novel algorithm for background??foreground segmentation. The work is motivated by the need for information about the background that is obscured by objects, in order to achieve accurate segmentation. The algorithm utilises the principle of estimating the occluded background by surface fitting. Edge detection methods are used to detect boundaries between foreground and background, identifying background points as well as foreground points. This categorisation will guarantee that most points used for surface fitting are from the same category and thus the proposed surface fitting with random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm will produce an accurate estimate of the surface. The authors algorithm has been applied to the real-world applications of segmenting plant images with inhomogeneous but smooth background and measuring the relative temperature of plants. Comparisons with experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is able to reduce significantly background inhomogeneities in infra-red images for the accurate estimation of temperature differences between background and plants, which provides important clues for fast and cheap genetic screening. The proposed algorithm is also able to overcome the intensity inhomogeneities for accurate image segmentation, particularly for plant root image segmentation with the preservation of lateral plant roots.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Multiphoton microscopy has emerged in the past decade as a useful noninvasive imaging technique for in vivo human skin characterization. However, it has not been used until now in evaluation clinical trials, mainly because of the lack of specific image processing tools that would allow the investigator to extract pertinent quantitative three-dimensional (3D) information from the different skin components.
METHODS: We propose a 3D automatic segmentation method of multiphoton images which is a key step for epidermis and dermis quantification. This method, based on the morphological watershed and graph cuts algorithms, takes into account the real shape of the skin surface and of the dermal-epidermal junction, and allows separating in 3D the epidermis and the superficial dermis.
RESULTS: The automatic segmentation method and the associated quantitative measurements have been developed and validated on a clinical database designed for aging characterization. The segmentation achieves its goals for epidermis-dermis separation and allows quantitative measurements inside the different skin compartments with sufficient relevance.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that multiphoton microscopy associated with specific image processing tools provides access to new quantitative measurements on the various skin components. The proposed 3D automatic segmentation method will contribute to build a powerful tool for characterizing human skin condition. To our knowledge, this is the first 3D approach to the segmentation and quantification of these original images.},

Methods to generate these superpixels have gained substantial interest in the last few years, but only a few have made it into applications in practice, in particular because the requirements on the processing time are essential but are not met by most of them. Here, we propose waterpixels as a general strategy for generating superpixels which relies on the marker controlled watershed transformation. We introduce a spatially regularized gradient to achieve a tunable tradeoff between the superpixel regularity and the adherence to object boundaries. The complexity of the resulting methods is linear with respect to the number of image pixels.

Since every morphological operator has a complementary operator that is equally and oppositely biased, the authors propose averaging the complementary operators to alleviate the bias. Of the three filters formed by averaging the standard morphological operators, two are the previously defined midrange filter, and pseudomedian filter, while one is a new filter, called the LOCO filter. Under most conditions, the LOCO filter is the best of these at reducing impulses and noise., Linear combinations of morphological operators allow the shape control of the morphological filters (exerted by the selection of a structuring element) without introducing bias. For example, the LOCO filter with a square structuring element preserves 90 degrees corners in an image while reducing noise almost as well as the square-shaped medium filter, which rounds off such corners.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we provide an extensive review of the state-of-the-art in scale-space generation techniques for image processing, including linear methods, diffusion-based methods, and emphasizing morphological methods. Then, we introduce a new morphological approach to scale-space, called the lomo scale-space. The technique introduces a novel two-dimensional generalization of the concept of locally monotonic (lomo) signals. The lomo scale-space is a sequence of locally monotonic image representations where the scale is specified by the spatial extent or degree of local monotonicity. The morphological process used to generate the lomo scale-space retains many desirable properties of other morphological methods, such as edge localization and smoothing of extrema. In contrast to previous morphological scale-space methods, the filters employed here are self-dual, and thus do not induce a gray-level bias into the scaled signal representations. The scale-space methods reviewed and introduced in this paper are applicable to several multiscale image processing tasks such as segmentation, object-based image compression, content-based retrieval, and video tracking.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {A method is presented for automated segmentation of vessels in two-dimensional color images of the retina. This method can be used in computer analyses of retinal images, e.g., in automated screening for diabetic retinopathy. The system is based on extraction of image ridges, which coincide approximately with vessel centerlines. The ridges are used to compose primitives in the form of line elements. With the line elements an image is partitioned into patches by assigning each image pixel to the closest line element. Every line element constitutes a local coordinate frame for its corresponding patch. For every pixel, feature vectors are computed that make use of properties of the patches and the line elements. The feature vectors are classified using a kNN-classifier and sequential forward feature selection. The algorithm was tested on a database consisting of 40 manually labeled images. The method achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.952. The method is compared with two recently published rule-based methods of Hoover et al. and Jiang et al. . The results show that our method is significantly better than the two rule-based methods (p{\textless}0.01). The accuracy of our method is 0.944 versus 0.947 for a second observer.},

The presence of exudates within the macular region is a main hallmark of diabetic macular edema and allows its detection with a high sensitivity. Hence, detection of exudates is an important diagnostic task, in which computer assistance may play a major role. Exudates are found using their high grey level variation, and their contours are determined by means of morphological reconstruction techniques. The detection of the optic disc is indispensable for this approach. We detect the optic disc by means of morphological filtering techniques and the watershed transformation. The algorithm has been tested on a small image data base and compared with the performance of a human grader. As a result, we obtain a mean sensitivity of 92.8\% and a mean predictive value of 92.4\%. Robustness with respect to changes of the parameters of the algorithm has been evaluated.},

However, there still does not exist any automatic segmentation procedure able to deal accurately with any kind of image. Thus semi-automatic segmentation methods may be seen as an appropriate alternative to solve the segmentation problem. Among these methods, the marker-based watershed has been successfully involved in various domains. In this algorithm, the user may locate the markers, which are used only as the initial starting positions of the regions to be segmented. We propose to base the segmentation process also on the contents of the markers through a supervised pixel classification, thus resulting in a knowledge-based watershed segmentation where the knowledge is built from the markers. Our contribution has been evaluated through some comparative tests with some state-of-the-art methods on the well-known Berkeley Segmentation Dataset.},

Moreover, Lazy Snapping provides instant visual feedback, snapping the cutout contour to the true object boundary efficiently despite the presence of ambiguous or low contrast edges. Instant feedback is made possible by a novel image segmentation algorithm which combines graph cut with pre-computed over-segmentation. A set of intuitive user interface (UI) tools is designed and implemented to provide flexible control and editing for the users. Usability studies indicate that Lazy Snapping provides a better user experience and produces better segmentation results than the state-of-the-art interactive image cutout tool, Magnetic Lasso in Adobe Photoshop.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE—To evaluate the performance of a system for automated detection of diabetic retinopathy in digital retinal photographs, built from published algorithms, in a large, representative, screening population.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—We conducted a retrospective analysis of 10,000 consecutive patient visits, specifically exams (four retinal photographs, two left and two right) from 5,692 unique patients from the EyeCheck diabetic retinopathy screening project imaged with three types of cameras at 10 centers. Inclusion criteria included no previous diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, no previous visit to ophthalmologist for dilated eye exam, and both eyes photographed. One of three retinal specialists evaluated each exam as unacceptable quality, no referable retinopathy, or referable retinopathy. We then selected exams with sufficient image quality and determined presence or absence of referable retinopathy. Outcome measures included area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (number needed to miss one case [NNM]) and type of false negative.
RESULTS—Total area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.84, and NNM was 80 at a sensitivity of 0.84 and a specificity of 0.64. At this point, 7,689 of 10,000 exams had sufficient image quality, 4,648 of 7,689 (60\%) were true negatives, 59 of 7,689 (0.8\%) were false negatives, 319 of 7,689 (4\%) were true positives, and 2,581 of 7,689 (33\%) were false positives. Twenty-seven percent of false negatives contained large hemorrhages and/or neovascularizations.
CONCLUSIONS—Automated detection of diabetic retinopathy using published algorithms cannot yet be recommended for clinical practice. However, performance is such that evaluation on validated, publicly available datasets should be pursued. If algorithms can be improved, such a system may in the future lead to improved prevention of blindness and vision loss in patients with diabetes.},

	abstract = {Aim To automatically classify abnormal retinal images from four different categories using artificial neural networks with a high degree of accuracy in minimal time to assist the ophthalmologist in subsequent treatment planning.
Methods We used 420 abnormal retinal images from four different categories (non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, central retinal vein occlusion, central serous retinopathy and central neo-vascularisation membrane). Green channel extraction, histogram equalisation and median filtering were used as image pre-processing techniques, followed by texture-based feature extraction. The application of Kohonen neural networks for pathology identification was also explored.
Results The approach described yielded an average classification accuracy of 97.7\% with ±0.8\% deviation for individual categories. The average sensitivity and the specificity values are 96\% and 98\%, respectively. The time taken by the Kohonen neural network to achieve these accurate results was 300±40 s for the 420 images.
Conclusion This study suggests that the approach described can act as a diagnostic tool for retinal disease identification. Simultaneous multi-level classification of abnormal images is possible with high accuracy using artificial neural networks. The results also suggest that the approach is time-efficient, which is essential for ophthalmologic applications.},

In the last years, multiphoton laser tomography (MLT) has emerged as a promising tool for non-invasive diagnostics in dermatology and other medical specialties. The present work is dedicated to the question to what degree the measurement depth and the thickness of the epidermis influence the evaluation of dermal matrix composition and if recommendations for future measurement procedures can be given.


METHODS

In a study group of 30 healthy volunteers aged 21-82 years multiphoton depth-resolved measurements of autofluorescence and second harmonics have been performed in order to evaluate the dermal matrix composition.


RESULTS

Characteristic intensity curves depending on the penetration depth were derived and differences between age groups were found.


CONCLUSION

With the present work we provide evidence for the accuracy of the measurement of dermal matrix composition by MLT and give detailed advice for the measurement procedure. Furthermore, we propose the use of depth-dependent emission intensity curves for monitoring of anti-aging treatment.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Among gynecologic cancers, ovarian cancer is the second most common and has the highest mortality. Currently, there is no accurate early diagnostic technique for ovarian cancer. Furthermore, little is understood regarding the early progression of this disease. We have imaged multiphoton interactions of endogenous tissue constituents from normal and abnormal ovarian biopsies that were kept viable during transport from the operating room and microscopy.
Experimental Design: The ovarian surface and underlying stroma were assessed with two-photon excited fluorescence (2PEF) and second harmonic generation (SHG). High-resolution, optically sectioned images were analyzed for epithelial morphology based on 2PEF and collagen density and structural integrity based on SHG. Additionally, multiwavelength 2PEF provided an estimation of the cellular redox ratio of epithelial cells.
Results: Normal tissue exhibited a uniform epithelial layer with highly structured collagen in the stroma, whereas abnormal tissue exhibited varied epithelium with large cells and substantial quantitative changes to the collagen structure. Samples from patients at high risk for developing ovarian cancer (based on their personal/family history of cancer) exhibited highly variable cellular redox ratios and changes in collagen structure that trended toward cancer samples.
Conclusion: This study highlights differences in endogenous signals in viable ovarian biopsies based on quantitative collagen structural changes and redox ratio estimates that may lead to improved detection and further insights in ovarian cancer, particularly in the early stages of the disease.

A superpixel is an image patch which is better aligned with intensity edges than a rectangular patch. Superpixels can be extracted with any segmentation algorithm, however, most of them produce highly irregular superpixels, with widely varying sizes and shapes. A more regular space tessellation may be desired. We formulate the superpixel partitioning problem in an energy minimization framework, and optimize with graph cuts. Our energy function explicitly encourages regular superpixels. We explore variations of the basic energy, which allow a trade-off between a less regular tessellation but more accurate boundaries or better efficiency. Our advantage over previous work is computational efficiency, principled optimization, and applicability to 3D “supervoxel” segmentation. We achieve high boundary recall on images and spatial coherence on video. We also show that compact superpixels improve accuracy on a simple application of salient object segmentation.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the ensemble clustering problem, where the input is in the form of multiple clustering solutions. The goal of ensemble clustering algorithms is to aggregate the solutions into one solution that maximizes the agreement in the input ensemble. We obtain several new results for this problem. Specifically, we show that the notion of agreement under such circumstances can be better captured using a 2D string encoding rather than a voting strategy, which is common among existing approaches. Our optimization proceeds by first constructing a non-linear objective function which is then transformed into a 0-1 Semidefinite program (SDP) using novel convexification techniques. This model can be subsequently relaxed to a polynomial time solvable SDP. In addition to the theoretical contributions, our experimental results on standard machine learning and synthetic datasets show that this approach leads to improvements not only in terms of the proposed agreement measure but also the existing agreement measures based on voting strategies. In addition, we identify several new application scenarios for this problem. These include combining multiple image segmentations and generating tissue maps from multiple-channel Diffusion Tensor brain images to identify the underlying structure of the brain.},

	abstract = {Purpose. To describe and evaluate the performance of an algorithm that automatically classifies images with pathologic features commonly found in diabetic retinopathy (DR) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
Methods. Retinal digital photographs (N = 2247) of three fields of view (FOV) were obtained of the eyes of 822 patients at two centers: The Retina Institute of South Texas (RIST, San Antonio, TX) and The University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio (UTHSCSA). Ground truth was provided for the presence of pathologic conditions, including microaneurysms, hemorrhages, exudates, neovascularization in the optic disc and elsewhere, drusen, abnormal pigmentation, and geographic atrophy. The algorithm was used to report on the presence or absence of disease. A detection threshold was applied to obtain different values of sensitivity and specificity with respect to ground truth and to construct a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
Results. The system achieved an average area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.89 for detection of DR and of 0.92 for detection of sight-threatening DR (STDR). With a fixed specificity of 0.50, the system's sensitivity ranged from 0.92 for all DR cases to 1.00 for clinically significant macular edema (CSME).
Conclusions. A computer-aided algorithm was trained to detect different types of pathologic retinal conditions. The cases of hard exudates within 1 disc diameter (DD) of the fovea (surrogate for CSME) were detected with very high accuracy (sensitivity = 1, specificity = 0.50), whereas mild nonproliferative DR was the most challenging condition (sensitivity= 0.92, specificity = 0.50). The algorithm was also tested on images with signs of AMD, achieving a performance of AUC of 0.84 (sensitivity = 0.94, specificity = 0.50).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Ethnic differences in skin structural features have not been thoroughly investigated, and the few reported studies are contradictory. Thus, we have carried out a set of in vivo measurements on the skin of about 400 volunteers from various ethnic origins living in the same environment.


METHODS

Female subjects were distributed into four ethnic groups: African Americans, Mexicans, Caucasians, and Chinese. Inter- and intra-ethnic skin structural differences, according to age and anatomic site, were investigated using three non-invasive skin-imaging methods: ultrasound (US) at 25 and 150 MHz, and optical coherence tomography (OCT).


RESULTS

The thickness of the skin is higher on the cheek compared with the dorsal and ventral forearm, with no ethnic or age-related specificity. We confirm that the sub-epidermal non-echogenic band is a sensitive marker of skin aging, and reveal for the first time that it is less pronounced in African Americans. From OCT images, we bring out evidence that the thickness of the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) decreased with age, and was higher in African Americans than in Caucasians. Finally, by comparing US images at 150 MHz with OCT images, we show that papillary dermis thickness can be measured and appears to be quite constant irrespective of age or ethnic group.


CONCLUSION

Our study confirms that skin imaging is very attractive to further our knowledge of the morphology of skin from various ethnic origins. Regarding age effects, quantitative parameters have shown that they would be delayed in African Americans compared with all other ethnic populations.},

However, there still does not exist any automatic segmentation procedure able to deal accurately with any kind of image. Thus semi-automatic segmentation methods may be seen as an appropriate alternative to solve the segmentation problem. Among these methods, the marker-based watershed has been successfully involved in various domains. In this algorithm, the user may locate the markers, which are used only as the initial starting positions of the regions to be segmented. We propose to base the segmentation process also on the contents of the markers through a supervised pixel classification, thus resulting in a knowledge-based watershed segmentation where the knowledge is built from the markers. Our contribution has been evaluated through some comparative tests with some state-of-the-art methods on the well-known Berkeley Segmentation Dataset.},

Productive computer-based screening of large, at-risk populations at low cost requires robust, automated image analysis. In this paper we present results for the automatic detection of the optic nerve and localization of the macula using digital red-free fundus photography. Our method relies on the accurate segmentation of the vasculature of the retina followed by the determination of spatial features describing the density, average thickness, and average orientation of the vasculature in relation to the position of the optic nerve. Localization of the macula follows using knowledge of the optic nerve location to detect the horizontal raphe of the retina using a geometric model of the vasculature. We report 90.4\% detection performance for the optic nerve and 92.5\% localization performance for the macula for red-free fundus images representing a population of 345 images corresponding to 269 patients with 18 different pathologies associated with DR and other common retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration.},

Despite an overall thinning of the epidermis and focal areas of cytologic atypia, the characteristic morphological markers associated with the keratinization process are not markedly altered in appearance or amount. A well-formed stratum corneum consisting of flattened, enucleated horny cells enveloped by a thickened membrane, and intracellular spaces filled with electron-dense material provide structural evidence that barrier ability is not compromised in senile skin. The dermal/epidermal changes in aged skin are marked and have significant physiologic implications. The major change is a relatively flat dermal/epidermal junction resulting from the retraction of the epidermal papillae as well as the microprojections of basal cells into the dermis. This flattening results in a more fragile epidermal/dermal interface and, consequently, the epidermis is less resistant to shearing forces. Retraction of the epidermal downgrowths (preferential sites of the putative epidermal stem cell) may also explain the loss in proliferative capacity associated with the aged epidermis. The three-dimensional arrangements of collagen and elastic fibers showed marked alterations with age. Both fibrous components appear more compact because of a decrease in spaces between the fibers. Collagen bundles appear to unravel, and the individual elastic fibers show signs of elastosis. These changes may contribute to the loss of resilience that is one of the salient features of senile skin.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the problem of retinal image registration, this paper introduces and analyzes a new registration algorithm called Dual-Bootstrap Iterative Closest Point (Dual-Bootstrap ICP). The approach is to start from one or more initial, low-order estimates that are only accurate in small image regions, called bootstrap regions. In each bootstrap region, the algorithm iteratively: 1) refines the transformation estimate using constraints only from within the bootstrap region; 2) expands the bootstrap region; and 3) tests to see if a higher order transformation model can be used, stopping when the region expands to cover the overlap between images. Steps 1): and 3), the bootstrap steps, are governed by the covariance matrix of the estimated transformation. Estimation refinement [Step 2)] uses a novel robust version of the ICP algorithm. In registering retinal image pairs, Dual-Bootstrap ICP is initialized by automatically matching individual vascular landmarks, and it aligns images based on detected blood vessel centerlines. The resulting quadratic transformations are accurate to less than a pixel. On tests involving approximately 6000 image pairs, it successfully registered 99.5\% of the pairs containing at least one common landmark, and 100\% of the pairs containing at least one common landmark and at least 35\% image overlap.},

In this work we present the results of the first international microaneurysm detection competition, organized in the context of the Retinopathy Online Challenge (ROC), a multiyear online competition for various aspects of DR detection. For this competition, we compare the results of five different methods, produced by five different teams of researchers on the same set of data. The evaluation was performed in a uniform manner using an algorithm presented in this work. The set of data used for the competition consisted of 50 training images with available reference standard and 50 test images where the reference standard was withheld by the organizers (M. Niemeijer, B. van Ginneken, and M. D. AbrA??moff). The results obtained on the test data was submitted through a website after which standardized evaluation software was used to determine the performance of each of the methods. A human expert detected microaneurysms in the test set to allow comparison with the performance of the automatic methods. The overall results show that microaneurysm detection is a challenging task for both the automatic methods as well as the human expert. There is room for improvement as the best performing system does not reach the performance of the human expert.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Quantitative morphometry developed rapidly during the last decade due to advances is computers and software. We wish to establish a simple baseline for the morphometric differences due to intrinsic ageing between young and old cohorts: the interdigitation index. It is an expression of the shape of the border between the epidermis and dermis. METHODS: We used volar forearm biopsies of women, since the volar forearm is usually not photodamaged. The biopsies were fixed in buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin and sectioned. Separate sections were stained by hematoxylin-eosin, by orcein and by dimethyl-methylene blue. We had seven female volunteers in each group; the young cohort had a mean age of 26.6 years, the older cohort 50.9 years. We chose a cohort that was just about postmenopausal, since in the future we wish to evaluate the effect of externally-applied agents on postmenopausal female skin and the earlier it is applied the better its chance of being effective. RESULTS: We found no difference between the young and older cohort with regard to epidermal thickness. We found a decrease of glycosaminoglycen (GAG) as measured by dimethyl-methylene blue staining. The results of the elastic staining by orcein, although in line with the reports in the literature, are not useful for evaluating the intrinsic ageing process, at least not by the simple percentage of area stained procedure. We introduced a new parameter: the interdigitation index. It is a simple measurement of the interdigitation in the epidermal-dermal junction, known to be diminished by age. This index was diminished by about 20\% between the young and older cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative morphometry using simple epidermal and dermal measurements on biopsies of the volar forearm of women is suitable for following intrinsic ageing of the skin and offers a simple objective method for following the ageing process of the skin.},

It treats the foreground and background of an image identically, i.e., it is self-dual. Unfortunately, the median operator has one major drawback: it is not idempotent. Even worse, subsequent iterations of a given image may lead to oscillations. This paper describes a general method for the construction of morphological operators which are self-dual. This construction is based upon the concept of a switch operator. Subsequently, the paper treats a class of operators, the so-called activity-extensive operators, which have the intriguing property that every sequence of iterates of a given image is pointwise monotone and therefore convergent. The underlying concept is that of the activity ordering. Every increasing, self-dual operator can be modified in such a way that it becomes activity-extensive. The sequence of iterates of this modification converges to a self-dual morphological filter.},

	abstract = {A novel multiple-instance learning framework, for automated image classification, is presented in this paper. Given reference images marked by clinicians as relevant or irrelevant, the image classifier is trained to detect patterns, of arbitrary size, that only appear in relevant images. After training, similar patterns are sought in new images in order to classify them as either relevant or irrelevant images. Therefore, no manual segmentations are required. As a consequence, large image datasets are available for training. The proposed framework was applied to diabetic retinopathy screening in 2-D retinal image datasets: Messidor (1200 images) and e-ophtha, a dataset of 25,702 examination records from the Ophdiat screening network (107,799 images). In this application, an image (or an examination record) is relevant if the patient should be referred to an ophthalmologist. Trained on one half of Messidor, the classifier achieved high performance on the other half of Messidor (A(z)=0.881) and on e-ophtha (A(z)=0.761). We observed, in a subset of 273 manually segmented images from e-ophtha, that all eight types of diabetic retinopathy lesions are detected.},

The authors' method differs from previously known methods in that it uses local and global vessel features cooperatively to segment the vessel network. The authors evaluate their method using hand-labeled ground truth segmentations of 20 images. A plot of the operating characteristic shows that the authors' method reduces false positives by as much as 15 times over basic thresholding of a matched filter response (MFR), at up to a 75\% true positive rate. For a baseline, they also compared the ground truth against a second hand-labeling, yielding a 90\% true positive and a 4\% false positive detection rate, on average. These numbers suggest there is still room for a 15\% true positive rate improvement, with the same false positive rate, over the authors' method.

Range images, which directly measure 3-D surface coordinates of a scene, are well suited for this task. In this paper we report a procedure to detect connected planar, convex, and concave surfaces of 3-D objects. This is accomplished in three stages. The first stage segments the range image into “surface patches” by a square error criterion clustering algorithm using surface points and associated surface normals. The second stage classifies these patches as planar, convex, or concave based on a non-parametric statistical test for trend, curvature values, and eigenvalue analysis. In the final stage, boundaries between adjacent surface patches are classified as crease or noncrease edges, and this information is used to merge compatible patches to produce reasonable faces of the object(s). This procedure has been successfully applied to a large number of real and synthetic images, four of which we present in this paper.},

	abstract = {SummaryBackground
Although limited data are available, it is commonly considered that Europeans and Asians have different skin ageing features.
Objectives
The present studies have been carried out to evaluate the influence of age and sun-exposure on the main clinical signs of Asian skin ageing.
Methods
One hundred and sixty Chinese and 160 French age-matched women (age range: 20–60 years old) were clinically examined and scored by the same dermatologist. Facial wrinkles (crow's-feet, glabella and perioral wrinkles) and pigmented spots (on face and hands) were assessed in situ and standardized photographs of the face were taken. Lifelong sun-exposure was estimated from answers to a questionnaire. Comparisons were made between 10-year age groups.
Results
Results show that, for each facial skin area, wrinkle onset is delayed by about 10 years in Chinese women as compared to French women. Facial wrinkling rate over the years is linear in French women and not linear in Chinese women who appear to experience a fast ageing process between age 40 and 50. Pigmented spot intensity is a much more important ageing sign in Chinese women (severe for 30\% of women over 40) than in French women (severe for less than 8\% of women, irrespective of age).
Conclusion
These first results underline that main skin ageing features (wrinkles, spots) progress differently in the Chinese and French women we have studied. They require to be confirmed on broad multicentre studies involving larger cohorts.},

It treats the foreground and background of an image identically, i.e., it is self-dual. Unfortunately, the median operator has one major drawback: it is not idempotent. Even worse, subsequent iterations of a given image may lead to oscillations. This paper describes a general method for the construction of morphological operators which are self-dual. This construction is based upon the concept of a switch operator. Subsequently, the paper treats a class of operators, the so-called activity-extensive operators, which have the intriguing property that every sequence of iterates of a given image is pointwise monotone and therefore convergent. The underlying concept is that of the activity ordering. Every increasing, self-dual operator can be modified in such a way that it becomes activity-extensive. The sequence of iterates of this modification converges to a self-dual morphological filter.},

                  Academic dermatology department.Participants and Materials 
                  Digital clinical images of pigmented cutaneous lesions (60 melanoma and 128 benign control lesions) with a histologic diagnosis rendered by a board-certified dermatopathologist, obtained before biopsy from patients undergoing lesion removal as a part of routine care.Main Outcome Measures 
                  Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 4 smartphone applications designed to aid nonclinician users in determining whether their skin lesion is benign or malignant.Results 
                  Sensitivity of the 4 tested applications ranged from 6.8\% to 98.1\%; specificity, 30.4\% to 93.7\%; positive predictive value, 33.3\% to 42.1\%; and negative predictive value, 65.4\% to 97.0\%. The highest sensitivity for melanoma diagnosis was observed for an application that sends the image directly to a board-certified dermatologist for analysis; the lowest, for applications that use automated algorithms to analyze images.Conclusions 
                  The performance of smartphone applications in assessing melanoma risk is highly variable, and 3 of 4 smartphone applications incorrectly classified 30\% or more of melanomas as unconcerning. Reliance on these applications, which are not subject to regulatory oversight, in lieu of medical consultation can delay the diagnosis of melanoma and harm users.},

A successive rejection-based strategy is proposed to progressively lower the number of clutter responses. The processing stages are designed to reject specific classes of clutter while passing majority of true MAs, using a set of specialized features. The true positives that remain after the final rejector are assigned a score which is based on its similarity to a true MA. Results of extensive evaluation of the proposed approach on three different retinal image datasets are reported, and used to highlight the promise in the presented strategy.},

	doi = {10.1063/1.3116626},
	abstract = {Collagen is the most prominent protein of human tissues. Its content and organization define to a large extent the mechanical properties of tissue as well as its function. Methods that have been used traditionally to visualize and analyze collagen are invasive, provide only qualitative or indirect information, and have limited use in studies that aim to understand the dynamic nature of collagen remodeling and its interactions with the surrounding cells and other matrix components. Second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging emerged as a promising noninvasive modality for providing high-resolution images of collagen fibers within thick specimens, such as tissues. In this article, we present a fully automated procedure to acquire quantitative information on the content, orientation, and organization of collagen fibers. We use this procedure to monitor the dynamic remodeling of collagen gels in the absence or presence of fibroblasts over periods of 12 or 14 days. We find that an adaptive thresholding and stretching approach provides great insight to the content of collagen fibers within SHG images without the need for user input. An additional feature-erosion and feature-dilation step is useful for preserving structure and noise removal in images with low signal. To quantitatively assess the orientation of collagen fibers, we extract the orientation index (OI), a parameter based on the power distribution of the spatial-frequency-averaged, two-dimensional Fourier transform of the SHG images. To measure the local organization of the collagen fibers, we access the Hough transform of small tiles of the image and compute the entropy distribution, which represents the probability of finding the direction of fibers along a dominant direction. Using these methods we observed that the presence and number of fibroblasts within the collagen gel significantly affects the remodeling of the collagen matrix. In the absence of fibroblasts, gels contract, especially during the first few d- ays, in a manner that allows the fibers to remain mostly disoriented, as indicated by small OI values. Subtle changes in the local organization of fibers may be taking place as the corresponding entropy values of these gels show a small decrease. The presence of fibroblasts affects the collagen matrix in a manner that is highly dependent on their number. A low density of fibroblasts enhances the rate of initial gel contraction, but ultimately leads to degradation of collagen fibers, which start to organize in localized clumps. This degradation and reorganization is seen within the first days of incubation with fibroblasts at a high density and is followed by de novo collagen fiber deposition by the fibroblasts. These collagen fibers are more highly oriented and organized than the fibers of the original collagen gel. These initial studies demonstrate that SHG imaging in combination with automated image analysis approaches offer a noninvasive and easily implementable method for characterizing important features of the content and organization of collagen in tissuelike specimens. Therefore, these studies could offer important insights for improving tissue engineering and disease diagnostic efforts.},

This objective may be appropriate if the selected points correspond to facility sites and the objective is to have as ‘dispersed’ a set as possible. This problem is NP-complete. Related graph theoretical problems are discussed, integer programming models are proposed, and an outline is given on a line search procedure to solve this problem optimally. Using a branch-and-bound procedure, problems with n = 40 and p = 16 can be solved on a microcomputer. The heuristic, developed to get an initial lower bound, finds an optimal solution for most of our random test problems. Also described is an extension to the basic problem that allows for preselected points, which may correspond to existing facility locations. This more general version can be solved by slight modifications of the algorithms.},

	abstract = {Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a common vision threatening complication of diabetic retinopathy. In a large scale screening environment DME can be assessed by detecting exudates (a type of bright lesions) in fundus images. In this work, we introduce a new methodology for diagnosis of DME using a novel set of features based on colour, wavelet decomposition and automatic lesion segmentation. These features are employed to train a classifier able to automatically diagnose DME through the presence of exudation. We present a new publicly available dataset with ground-truth data containing 169 patients from various ethnic groups and levels of DME. This and other two publicly available datasets are employed to evaluate our algorithm. We are able to achieve diagnosis performance comparable to retina experts on the MESSIDOR (an independently labelled dataset with 1200 images) with cross-dataset testing (e.g., the classifier was trained on an independent dataset and tested on MESSIDOR). Our algorithm obtained an AUC between 0.88 and 0.94 depending on the dataset/features used. Additionally, it does not need ground truth at lesion level to reject false positives and is computationally efficient, as it generates a diagnosis on an average of 4.4 s (9.3 s, considering the optic nerve localisation) per image on an 2.6 GHz platform with an unoptimised Matlab implementation.},

	abstract = {Aims: National screening programmes for diabetic retinopathy using digital photography and multi-level manual grading systems are currently being implemented in the UK. Here, we assess the cost-effectiveness of replacing first level manual grading in the National Screening Programme in Scotland with an automated system developed to assess image quality and detect the presence of any retinopathy.
Methods: A decision tree model was developed and populated using sensitivity/specificity and cost data based on a study of 6722 patients in the Grampian region. Costs to the NHS, and the number of appropriate screening outcomes and true referable cases detected in 1 year were assessed.
Results: For the diabetic population of Scotland (approximately 160 000), with prevalence of referable retinopathy at 4\% (6400 true cases), the automated strategy would be expected to identify 5560 cases (86.9\%) and the manual strategy 5610 cases (87.7\%). However, the automated system led to savings in grading and quality assurance costs to the NHS of £201 600 per year. The additional cost per additional referable case detected (manual vs automated) totalled £4088 and the additional cost per additional appropriate screening outcome (manual vs automated) was £1990.
Conclusions: Given that automated grading is less costly and of similar effectiveness, it is likely to be considered a cost-effective alternative to manual grading.},

	abstract = {Background Stromal-epithelial interactions are of particular significance in breast tissue as misregulation of these interactions can promote tumorigenesis and invasion. Moreover, collagen-dense breast tissue increases the risk of breast carcinoma, although the relationship between collagen density and tumorigenesis is not well understood. As little is known about epithelial-stromal interactions in vivo, it is necessary to visualize the stroma surrounding normal epithelium and mammary tumors in intact tissues to better understand how matrix organization, density, and composition affect tumor formation and progression. Methods Epithelial-stromal interactions in normal mammary glands, mammary tumors, and tumor explants in three-dimensional culture were studied with histology, electron microscopy, and nonlinear optical imaging methodologies. Imaging of the tumor-stromal interface in live tumor tissue ex vivo was performed with multiphoton laser-scanning microscopy (MPLSM) to generate multiphoton excitation (MPE) of endogenous fluorophores and second harmonic generation (SHG) to image stromal collagen. Results We used both laser-scanning multiphoton and second harmonic generation microscopy to determine the organization of specific collagen structures around ducts and tumors in intact, unfixed and unsectioned mammary glands. Local alterations in collagen density were clearly seen, allowing us to obtain three-dimensional information regarding the organization of the mammary stroma, such as radiating collagen fibers that could not have been obtained using classical histological techniques. Moreover, we observed and defined three tumor-associated collagen signatures (TACS) that provide novel markers to locate and characterize tumors. In particular, local cell invasion was found predominantly to be oriented along certain aligned collagen fibers, suggesting that radial alignment of collagen fibers relative to tumors facilitates invasion. Consistent with this observation, primary tumor explants cultured in a randomly organized collagen matrix realigned the collagen fibers, allowing individual tumor cells to migrate out along radially aligned fibers. Conclusion The presentation of these tumor-associated collagen signatures allowed us to identify pre-palpable tumors and see cells at the tumor-stromal boundary invading into the stroma along radially aligned collagen fibers. As such, TACS should provide indications that a tumor is, or could become, invasive, and may serve as part of a strategy to help identify and characterize breast tumors in animal and human tissues.},

The commonly used precision and recall measures are computed from the overlap area of these two rectangles. However, these measures have several drawbacks: they don't give intuitive information about the proportion of the correctly detected objects and the number of false alarms, and they cannot be accumulated across multiple images without creating ambiguity in their interpretation. Furthermore, quantitative and qualitative evaluation is often mixed resulting in ambiguous measures. In this paper we propose a new approach which tackles these problems. The performance of a detection algorithm is illustrated intuitively by performance graphs which present object level precision and recall depending on constraints on detection quality. In order to compare different detection algorithms, a representative single performance value is computed from the graphs. The influence of the test database on the detection performance is illustrated by performance/generality graphs. The evaluation method can be applied to different types of object detection algorithms. It has been tested on different text detection algorithms, among which are the participants of the ICDAR 2003 text detection competition.},

	abstract = {Objective
This work proposes creating an automatic system to locate and segment the optic nerve head (ONH) in eye fundus photographic images using genetic algorithms.
Methods and material
Domain knowledge is used to create a set of heuristics that guide the various steps involved in the process. Initially, using an eye fundus colour image as input, a set of hypothesis points was obtained that exhibited geometric properties and intensity levels similar to the ONH contour pixels. Next, a genetic algorithm was used to find an ellipse containing the maximum number of hypothesis points in an offset of its perimeter, considering some constraints. The ellipse thus obtained is the approximation to the ONH. The segmentation method is tested in a sample of 110 eye fundus images, belonging to 55 patients with glaucoma (23.1\%) and eye hypertension (76.9\%) and random selected from an eye fundus image base belonging to the Ophthalmology Service at Miguel Servet Hospital, Saragossa (Spain).
Results and conclusions
The results obtained are competitive with those in the literature. The method's generalization capability is reinforced when it is applied to a different image base from the one used in our study and a discrepancy curve is obtained very similar to the one obtained in our image base. In addition, the robustness of the method proposed can be seen in the high percentage of images obtained with a discrepancy δ{\textless}5 (96\% and 99\% in our and a different image base, respectively). The results also confirm the hypothesis that the ONH contour can be properly approached with a non-deformable ellipse. Another important aspect of the method is that it directly provides the parameters characterising the shape of the papilla: lengths of its major and minor axes, its centre of location and its orientation with regard to the horizontal position.},

	abstract = {Fundus images are valuable resource in diagnosis because they often present indications about retinal, ophthalmic, and even systemic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and arteriosclerosis. Processing and analysis constitutes a relevant task to help specialists in detecting eye diseases. This paper focuses on algorithms to detect macula, a fundamental structure associated with the macular degeneration, that can be recognized from fundus image. We notice two typical ways in which macula detection algorithms have been evaluated: a) one uses a particular image or a single benchmark retina image database instead of several public ones; b) one selects an ad-hoc set of metrics to perform the evaluation for the lack of a standard. In this paper, we propose a set of rules to assess macula detection algorithms, then we compare four macula detection algorithms, using three public benchmark databases, using a total of 254 images. The contribution of this work is to devise a grading scheme that allows comparing different algorithms, as well as identifying cases that are likely to contain macular abnormalities. Finally, the proposed assessment methodology splits the results into success, satisfactory and failure, such that it provides an easier entry to the specialists to address and grade macular edema disease.},

In medical image analysis tasks, the majority of training examples are easy to classify and therefore contribute little to the CNN learning process. In this paper, we propose a method to improve and speed-up the CNN training for medical image analysis tasks by dynamically selecting misclassified negative samples during training. Training samples are heuristically sampled based on classification by the current status of the CNN. Weights are assigned to the training samples and informative samples are more likely to be included in the next CNN training iteration. We evaluated and compared our proposed method by training a CNN with (SeS) and without (NSeS) the selective sampling method. We focus on the detection of hemorrhages in color fundus images. A decreased training time from 170 epochs to 60 epochs with an increased performance-on par with two human experts-was achieved with areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.894 and 0.972 on two data sets. The SeS CNN statistically outperformed the NSeS CNN on an independent test set.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been achieving state-of-the-art performance on a variety of pattern-recognition tasks, most notably visual classification problems. Given that DNNs are now able to classify objects in images with near-human-level performance, questions naturally arise as to what differences remain between computer and human vision. A recent study [30] revealed that changing an image (e.g. of a lion) in a way imperceptible to humans can cause a DNN to label the image as something else entirely (e.g. mislabeling a lion a library). Here we show a related result: it is easy to produce images that are completely unrecognizable to humans, but that state-of-the-art DNNs believe to be recognizable objects with 99.99\% confidence (e.g. labeling with certainty that white noise static is a lion). Specifically, we take convolutional neural networks trained to perform well on either the ImageNet or MNIST datasets and then find images with evolutionary algorithms or gradient ascent that DNNs label with high confidence as belonging to each dataset class. It is possible to produce images totally unrecognizable to human eyes that DNNs believe with near certainty are familiar objects, which we call “fooling images” (more generally, fooling examples). Our results shed light on interesting differences between human vision and current DNNs, and raise questions about the generality of DNN computer vision.},

	abstract = {Fundus camera imaging is widely used to document disorders such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Multiple retinal images can be combined together through a procedure known as mosaicing to form an image with a larger field of view. Mosaicing typically requires multiple pairwise registrations of partially overlapped images. We describe a new method for pairwise retinal image registration. The proposed method is unique in that the radial distortion due to image acquisition is corrected prior to the geometric transformation. Vessel lines are detected using the Hessian operator and are used as input features to the registration. Since the overlapping region is typically small in a retinal image pair, only a few correspondences are available, thus limiting the applicable model to an afine transform at best. To recover the distortion due to curved-surface of retina and lens optics, a combined approach of an afine model with a radial distortion correction is proposed. The parameters of the image acquisition and radial distortion models are estimated during an optimization step that uses Powell's method driven by the vessel line distance. Experimental results using 20 pairs of green channel images acquired from three subjects with a fundus camera confirmed that the afine model with distortion correction could register retinal image pairs to within 1.88±0.35 pixels accuracy (mean ± standard deviation) assessed by vessel line error, which is 17\% better than the afine-only approach. Because the proposed method needs only two correspondences, it can be applied to obtain good registration accuracy even in the case of small overlap between retinal image pairs.},

Unlike most previous work on the subject (Denker et al., 1989), the learning network is directly fed with images, rather than feature vectors, thus demonstrating the ability of BP networks to deal with large amounts of low level information.

The winning team had no prior experience with EM images, and employed a convolutional network. This “deep learning” approach has since become accepted as a standard for segmentation of EM images. The challenge has continued to accept submissions, and the best so far has resulted from cooperation between two teams. The challenge has probably saturated, as algorithms cannot progress beyond limits set by ambiguities inherent in 2D scoring and the size of the test dataset. Retrospective evaluation of the challenge scoring system reveals that it was not sufficiently robust to variations in the widths of neurite borders.

A challenging problem is to detect a clinically important subsurface section of the skin, the Dermis/Epidermis junction, in RCM images. This is a tough problem because of the huge variation of texture and intensity features across both intersubject and intrasubject tissues. On the other hand, there's almost no wrinkle-free part of the skin. This well-known phenomenon can be used as a histological clue for guessing the probability of being Dermis or Epidermis in the neighboring regions. In this paper, we develop a two-step wrinkle detector for RCM images. By analyzing the results on different RCM images, we conclude it has high sensitivity and specificity, but a relatively lower Jaccard index.},

In particular, skin wrinkles typically occur due to aging processes, including loss of body mass, sun damage, smoking, squinting and other factors. They represent a clear and easily accessible indicator of changes. As such, one can also acquire useful information about the aging process in skin by analyzing the wrinkles. To this end, we utilize a combination of numerical techniques, including color quantization, image segmentation, and various edge detection algorithms in order to perform automated wrinkle counting and wrinkle density calculations. As a more appropriate alternative to chronological age, such a methodology allows us to come up with quantifiable measures for skin aging, which may be used for performing statistics and extracting general patterns associated with physiological aging of the skin, as well as extending such numerical techniques for other biomedical applications in which distinct topological features contain important information about biological processes. Different subjects were used to test the techniques and extract aging patterns by examining the skin immediately underneath the lower eyelid as our region of interest. Numerically processed photographs, included counting the number of wrinkles meeting predefined threshold conditions, and calculating the corresponding wrinkle density for a given subject and particular conditions.

The detection of wrinkles/imperfections can allow these skin features to be processed differently than the surrounding skin without much user interaction. For detection, Gabor filter responses along with texture orientation field are used as image features. A bimodal Gaussian mixture model (GMM) represents distributions of Gabor features of normal skin versus skin imperfections. Then, a Markov random field model is used to incorporate the spatial relationships among neighboring pixels for their GMM distributions and texture orientations. An expectation-maximization algorithm then classifies skin versus skin wrinkles/imperfections. Once detected automatically, wrinkles/imperfections are removed completely instead of being blended or blurred.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00561},
	abstract = {We present a novel and practical deep fully convolutional neural network architecture for semantic pixel-wise segmentation termed SegNet. This core trainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding decoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture of the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional layers in the VGG16 network . The role of the decoder network is to map the low resolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for pixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which the decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically, the decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the corresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the need for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then convolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps. We compare our proposed architecture with the fully convolutional network (FCN) architecture and its variants. This comparison reveals the memory versus accuracy trade-off involved in achieving good segmentation performance. The design of SegNet was primarily motivated by road scene understanding applications. Hence, it is efficient both in terms of memory and computational time during inference. It is also significantly smaller in the number of trainable parameters than competing architectures and can be trained end-to-end using stochastic gradient descent. We also benchmark the performance of SegNet on Pascal VOC12 salient object segmentation and the recent SUN RGB-D indoor scene understanding challenge. We show that SegNet provides competitive performance although it is significantly smaller than other architectures. We also provide a Caffe implementation of SegNet and a webdemo at http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/},

However, the differences between those models makes a comparison of the properties of different aggregation functions hard. Our aim is to gain insight into different functions by directly comparing them on a fixed architecture for several common object recognition tasks. Empirical results show that a maximum pooling operation significantly outperforms subsampling operations. Despite their shift-invariant properties, overlapping pooling windows are no significant improvement over non-overlapping pooling windows. By applying this knowledge, we achieve state-of-the-art error rates of 4.57\% on the NORB normalized-uniform dataset and 5.6\% on the NORB jittered-cluttered dataset.},

	abstract = {The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) challenge consists of two components: (i) a publicly available dataset of images together with ground truth annotation and standardised evaluation software; and (ii) an annual competition and workshop. There are five challenges: classification, detection, segmentation, action classification, and person layout. In this paper we provide a review of the challenge from 2008–2012. The paper is intended for two audiences: algorithm designers, researchers who want to see what the state of the art is, as measured by performance on the VOC datasets, along with the limitations and weak points of the current generation of algorithms; and, challenge designers, who want to see what we as organisers have learnt from the process and our recommendations for the organisation of future challenges. To analyse the performance of submitted algorithms on the VOC datasets we introduce a number of novel evaluation methods: a bootstrapping method for determining whether differences in the performance of two algorithms are significant or not; a normalised average precision so that performance can be compared across classes with different proportions of positive instances; a clustering method for visualising the performance across multiple algorithms so that the hard and easy images can be identified; and the use of a joint classifier over the submitted algorithms in order to measure their complementarity and combined performance. We also analyse the community’s progress through time using the methods of Hoiem et al. (Proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision, 2012) to identify the types of occurring errors. We conclude the paper with an appraisal of the aspects of the challenge that worked well, and those that could be improved in future challenges.},

Methods of designing and training LPNN are represented, including the quantization of non-linear activation function and the selection of learning rate, network architecture and weights precision. The optimized LPWNN performance has been evaluated by comparing to conventional neural networks with double-precision floating-point weights on road recognition of image for intelligent vehicle in ARM 9 embedded systems, and the results show the optimized LPWNN has 7 times faster than the conventional ones.},

	abstract = {Optic disc (OD) is a key structure in retinal images. It serves as an indicator to detect various diseases such as glaucoma and changes related to new vessel formation on the OD in diabetic retinopathy (DR) or retinal vein occlusion. OD is also essential to locate structures such as the macula and the main vascular arcade. Most existing methods for OD localization are rule-based, either exploiting the OD appearance proper- ties or the spatial relationship between the OD and the main vascular arcade. The detection of OD abnormalities has been performed through the detection of lesions such as hemorrhaeges or through measuring cup to disc ratio. Thus these methods result in complex and in exible im- age analysis algorithms limiting their applicability to large image sets obtained either in epidemiological studies or in screening for retinal or optic nerve diseases. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end supervised model for OD abnormality detection. The most informative features of the OD are learned directly from retinal images and are adapted to the dataset at hand. Our experimental results validated the effectiveness of this current approach and showed its potential application.},

In this paper, we propose a new approach which works on range data directly and registers successive views with enough overlapping area to get an accurate transformation between views.

	abstract = {This paper describes a general purpose, representation independent method for the accurate and computationally efficient registration of 3-D shapes including free-form curves and surfaces. The method handles the full six-degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and experience shows that the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of 'shape complexity', one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. For examples, a given 'model' shape and a sensed 'data' shape that represents a major portion of the model shape can be registered in minutes by testing one initial translation and a relatively small set of rotations to allow for the given level of model complexity. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model prior to shape inspection. The described method is also useful for deciding fundamental issues such as the congruence (shape equivalence) of different geometric representations as well as for estimating the motion between point sets where the correspondences are not known. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces.},

All information necessary to perform image segmentation is automatically derived from a training set that is presented in a form of segmentation examples. The training set is used to construct two models representing the objects-shape model and border appearance model. A two-step approach to image segmentation is reported. In the first step, an approximate location of the object of interest is determined. In the second step, accurate border segmentation is performed. The shape-variant Hough transform method was developed that provides robust object localization automatically. It finds objects of arbitrary shape, rotation, or scaling and can handle object variability. The border appearance model was developed to automatically design cost functions that can be used in the segmentation criteria of edge-based segmentation methods. The authors' method was tested in five different segmentation tasks that included 489 objects to be segmented. The final segmentation was compared to manually defined borders with good results [rms errors in pixels: 1.2 (cerebellum), 1.1 (corpus callosum), 1.5 (vertebrae), 1.4 (epicardial), and 1.6 (endocardial) borders]. Two major problems of the state-of-the-art edge-based image segmentation algorithms were addressed: strong dependency on a close-to-target initialization, and necessity for manual redesign of segmentation criteria whenever new segmentation problem is encountered.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a fully automatic brain tumor segmentation method based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The proposed networks are tailored to glioblastomas (both low and high grade) pictured in MR images. By their very nature, these tumors can appear anywhere in the brain and have almost any kind of shape, size, and contrast. These reasons motivate our exploration of a machine learning solution that exploits a flexible, high capacity DNN while being extremely efficient. Here, we give a description of different model choices that we’ve found to be necessary for obtaining competitive performance. We explore in particular different architectures based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), i.e. DNNs specifically adapted to image data.

We present a novel CNN architecture which differs from those traditionally used in computer vision. Our CNN exploits both local features as well as more global contextual features simultaneously. Also, different from most traditional uses of CNNs, our networks use a final layer that is a convolutional implementation of a fully connected layer which allows a 40 fold speed up. We also describe a 2-phase training procedure that allows us to tackle difficulties related to the imbalance of tumor labels. Finally, we explore a cascade architecture in which the output of a basic CNN is treated as an additional source of information for a subsequent CNN. Results reported on the 2013 BRATS test data-set reveal that our architecture improves over the currently published state-of-the-art while being over 30 times faster.},

Our pipeline starts from classification of the pixels based on 3D pixel features, which is followed by segmentation with an Ising model MRF and another classification step, based on object-level features. Classifiers are learned on sparse user labels; a fully annotated data subvolume is not required for training. The algorithm was validated on a set of 238 synapses in 20 serial 7197×7351 pixel images (4.5×4.5×45 nm resolution) of mouse visual cortex, manually labeled by three independent human annotators and additionally re-verified by an expert neuroscientist. The error rate of the algorithm (12\% false negative, 7\% false positive detections) is better than state-of-the-art, even though, unlike the state-of-the-art method, our algorithm does not require a prior segmentation of the image volume into cells. The software is based on the ilastik learning and segmentation toolkit and the vigra image processing library and is freely available on our website, along with the test data and gold standard annotations (http://www.ilastik.org/synapse-detection/sstem).},

Following the CANDELS main morphology classification scheme, our model retrieves for each galaxy the probabilities of having a spheroid or a disk, presenting an irregularity, being compact or a point source, and being unclassifiable. ConvNets are able to predict the fractions of votes given to a galaxy image with zero bias and ∼10\% scatter. The fraction of mis-classifications is less than 1\%. Our classification scheme represents a major improvement with respect to Concentration-Asymmetry-Smoothness-based methods, which hit a 20\%–30\% contamination limit at high z .

The network is self-organized by “learning without a teacher”, and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname “neocognitron”. After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of “S-cells”, which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of “C-cells” similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any “teacher” during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern.},

The resulting feature extractor consists of multiple convolution filters, followed by a feature-pooling layer that computes the max of each filter output within adjacent windows, and a point-wise sigmoid non-linearity. A second level of larger and more invariant features is obtained by training the same algorithm on patches of features from the first level. Training a supervised classifier on these features yields 0.64\% error on MNIST, and 54\% average recognition rate on Caltech 101 with 30 training samples per category. While the resulting architecture is similar to convolutional networks, the layer-wise unsupervised training procedure alleviates the over-parameterization problems that plague purely supervised learning procedures, and yields good performance with very few labeled training samples.},

We re-evaluate the state of the art for object recognition from small images with convolutional networks, questioning the necessity of different components in the pipeline. We find that max-pooling can simply be replaced by a convolutional layer with increased stride without loss in accuracy on several image recognition benchmarks. Following this finding -- and building on other recent work for finding simple network structures -- we propose a new architecture that consists solely of convolutional layers and yields competitive or state of the art performance on several object recognition datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet). To analyze the network we introduce a new variant of the "deconvolution approach" for visualizing features learned by CNNs, which can be applied to a broader range of network structures than existing approaches.},

	abstract = {With recent progress in graphics, it has become more tractable to train models on synthetic images, potentially avoiding the need for expensive annotations. However, learning from synthetic images may not achieve the desired performance due to a gap between synthetic and real image distributions. To reduce this gap, we propose Simulated+Unsupervised (S+U) learning, where the task is to learn a model to improve the realism of a simulator's output using unlabeled real data, while preserving the annotation information from the simulator. We develop a method for S+U learning that uses an adversarial network similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), but with synthetic images as inputs instead of random vectors. We make several key modifications to the standard GAN algorithm to preserve annotations, avoid artifacts and stabilize training: (i) a 'self-regularization' term, (ii) a local adversarial loss, and (iii) updating the discriminator using a history of refined images. We show that this enables generation of highly realistic images, which we demonstrate both qualitatively and with a user study. We quantitatively evaluate the generated images by training models for gaze estimation and hand pose estimation. We show a significant improvement over using synthetic images, and achieve state-of-the-art results on the MPIIGaze dataset without any labeled real data.},

	abstract = {Despite their massive size, successful deep artificial neural networks can exhibit a remarkably small difference between training and test performance. Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model family, or to the regularization techniques used during training. Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice. We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models.},

Using a dataset with 58 H\&E stained breast cancer biopsy images, we find that the convolutional networks, with 3 hidden layers and 8 feature maps per hidden layer, provide superior performance to other pixel classification methods including FLDA and SVM. We also show two important properties of the convolutional networks as a segmentation method. First, as a machine learning approach, the convolution networks encode enough high-level domain-specific knowledge into the final segmentation strategy by learning the training data. Second, the convolutional networks can use appropriate amount of context information in segmenting by optimizing the weights of the filters in the networks through the learning process.

They explore all paths from a defined class, and filter them with a length criterion. However, most paths are redundant, making the process generally slow. Parsimonious path openings and closings are introduced in this paper to solve this problem. These operators only consider a subset of the paths considered by classical path openings, thus achieving a substantial speed-up, while obtaining similar results. In addition, a recently introduced 1D opening algorithm is applied along each selected path. Its complexity is linear with respect to the number of pixels, independent of the size of the opening. Furthermore, it is fast for any input data accuracy (integer or floating point) and works in stream. Parsimonious path openings are also extended to incomplete paths, i.e., paths containing gaps. Noise-corrupted paths can thus be processed with the same approach and complexity. These parsimonious operators achieve a several orders of magnitude speed-up. Examples are shown for incomplete path openings, where computing times are brought from minutes to tens of milliseconds, while obtaining similar results.},

However the number of such paths is prohibitive and the resulting algorithm by simple composition is inefficient.In this paper we propose a way to compute openings and closings over large numbers of constrained, oriented paths in an efficient manner, suitable for building filters with applications to the analysis of oriented features, such as for example texture.},

The method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without tricks, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition. Code will be made available.},

The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of 'shape complexity', one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model, prior to shape inspection. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

Currently, the theory has only been implemented to classify input images into one of three age-groups: babies, young adults, and senior adults. The computations are based on cranio-facial development theory and skin wrinkle analysis. In the implementation, primary features of the face are found first, followed by secondary feature analysis. The primary features are the eyes, nose, mouth, chin, virtual-top of the head and the sides of the face. From these features, ratios that distinguish babies from young adults and seniors are computed. In secondary feature analysis, a wrinkle geography map is used to guide the detection and measurement of wrinkles. The wrinkle index computed is sufficient to distinguish seniors from young adults and babies. A combination rule for the ratios and the wrinkle index thus permits categorization of a face into one of three classes. Results using real images are presented. This is the first work involving age classification, and the first work that successfully extracts and uses natural wrinkles. It is also a successful demonstration that facial features are sufficient for a classification task, a finding that is important to the debate about what are appropriate representations for facial analysis.},

Facial wrinkles are 3D features of skin and appear as subtle discontinuities or cracks in surrounding skin texture. However, facial wrinkles can easily be masked by illumination/acquisition conditions in 2D images due to the specific nature of skin surface texture and its reflective properties. Existing approaches to image-based analysis of aging skin are based on the analysis of wrinkles as texture and not as curvilinear discontinuity/crack features. Previously, we proposed a stochastic approach based on Marked Point Processes (MPP) to localize facial wrinkles as curves. In this paper, we present a fast deterministic algorithm based on Gabor filters and image morphology to improve localization results. We propose image features based on Gabor filter bank to highlight the subtle curvilinear discontinuities in skin texture caused by wrinkles. Then, image morphology is used to incorporate geometric constraints to localize curvilinear shapes of wrinkles at image sites of large Gabor filter responses. Experiments are conducted on two sets of low and high resolution images and results are compared with those of MPP modeling. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm not only is significantly faster than MPP-based approach but also provides visually better results.},

	abstract = {Background

As people mature, their skin gradually presents lines, wrinkles, and folds that become more pronounced with time. Skin wrinkles are perceived as important cues in communicating information about the age of the person. Nowadays, documenting the facial appearance through imaging is prevalent in skin research, therefore detection and quantitative assessment of the degree of facial wrinkling can be a useful tool for establishing an objective baseline and for assessing benefits to facial appearance due to various dermatological treatments. However, few image-based algorithms for computationally assessing facial wrinkles are present in the literature, and those that exist have limited reliability.


Methods

In this work, an algorithm for automatic detection of facial wrinkles is developed, based on estimating the orientation and the frequency of elongated spatial features, captured via digital image filtering.


Results

The algorithm is tested against one set of clinically validated 11-point wrinkle scales present on the face. The algorithm is employed for assessing the presence of forehead furrows on a set of 100 clinically graded facial images. The proposed computational assessment correlates well with the corresponding clinical scores.


Conclusion

We find that the results are in better agreement with clinical scoring when the wrinkle depth information, approximated via filter responses, is combined with the wrinkle length information as opposed to the case when the two measures are considered separately.},

The significance of these applications has conducted important efforts to propose curvilinear object segmentation algorithms based on the most different techniques. The main objective of this review is to clearly present the similarities and differences between curvilinear structures in different applications and the different techniques used to segment them more effectively. To do so, we propose a general definition of curvilinear structures that encompasses the distinct models considered in the literature. In addition, we analyse and classify the mathematical techniques used to segment the curvilinear structures found across all considered applications, studying their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, we present the most relevant benchmarks related to curvilinear object segmentation as well as the best algorithms according to several performance measures. By doing so, it is acquired a wider point of view to extend the results from some fields to others, and to understand under which conditions some methodologies should be favoured over the rest of them.},

	abstract = {Age estimation from facial images is increasingly receiving attention to solve age-based access control, age-adaptive targeted marketing, amongst other applications. Since even humans can be induced in error due to the complex biological processes involved, finding a robust method remains a research challenge today. In this paper, we propose a new framework for the integration of Active Appearance Models (AAM), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gabor wavelets (GW) and Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) in order to obtain a highly discriminative feature representation which is able to model shape, appearance, wrinkles and skin spots. In addition, this paper proposes a novel flexible hierarchical age estimation approach consisting of a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify a subject into an age group followed by a Support Vector Regression (SVR) to estimate a specific age. The errors that may happen in the classification step, caused by the hard boundaries between age classes, are compensated in the specific age estimation by a flexible overlapping of the age ranges. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated on FG-NET Aging and MORPH Album 2 datasets and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.50 and 5.86 years was achieved respectively. The robustness of the proposed approach was also evaluated on a merge of both datasets and a MAE of 5.20 years was achieved. Furthermore, we have also compared the age estimation made by humans with the proposed approach and it has shown that the machine outperforms humans. The proposed approach is competitive with current state-of-the-art and it provides an additional robustness to blur, lighting and expression variance brought about by the local phase features.},

This problem, known as the ‘curse of dimensionality’, is an obstacle for many anomaly detection techniques. Building a robust anomaly detection model for use in high-dimensional spaces requires the combination of an unsupervised feature extractor and an anomaly detector. While one-class support vector machines are effective at producing decision surfaces from well-behaved feature vectors, they can be inefficient at modelling the variation in large, high-dimensional datasets. Architectures such as deep belief networks (DBNs) are a promising technique for learning robust features. We present a hybrid model where an unsupervised DBN is trained to extract generic underlying features, and a one-class SVM is trained from the features learned by the DBN. Since a linear kernel can be substituted for nonlinear ones in our hybrid model without loss of accuracy, our model is scalable and computationally efficient.

	abstract = {Purpose

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the major cause of blindness in the working-age population. With an increasing number of diabetic patients worldwide, automated screening tools become indispensable. Recent progress in machine learning and image analysis enables efficient automated screening.


Methods

DreamUp Vision uses state-of the art technology based on deep-learning. Our algorithm was trained on over 70,000 labeled retinal images. Images were graded by ophthalmologists as follows: 0 (no retinopathy), 1 (mild non proliferative DR), 2 (moderate non proliferative DR), 3 (severe non proliferative DR) and 4 (proliferative retinopathy). Each patient in the dataset is represented by two images of left and right eyes. Grading is done for each eye image separately. Our algorithm performs quick and reliable detection of anomalies in retinal images, diagnoses their stage of diabetic retinopathy and provides the location of the anomalies detected in the pictures. We consider a patient as referable if the DR stage is between 2 and 4, otherwise we consider the patient as non-referable. We evaluate our model on over 10,000 fundus images from 5,000 patients taken from the Kaggle DR Detection Challenge dataset, provided by California Healthcare Foundation.


Results

Our algorithm achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUROC of 0.946 with 96.2\% sensitivity (95\% CI: 95.8–96.5) and 66.6\% specificity (95\% CI: 65.7–67.5) for identifying referable DR on the Kaggle dataset.


Conclusions

The performances we have obtained enable a reliable automated DR screening. As the amount of available labeled data grows and given our technology's ability to learn from labeled images, we believe that significant performance improvement can be achieved. The same process can be applied to the detection of other eye diseases as well.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel hyperspectral image (HSI) classification method to effectively exploit the 3D spectral-spatial information via superpixel-based 3D deep neural networks (3D DNNs). Superpixel can represent the structure of HSI with adaptive sizes and shapes, and therefore, it is incorporated into 3D DNNs to improve the classification performance, especially for noisy classification and boundary misclassification. First, a spatial feature image via superpixel is constructed to increase the spectral-spatial similarity and diversity. Second, a 3D superpixel-based sample filling method is designed to solve the misclassification problem of boundaries. Third, a 3D recurrent convolutional networks (3D RCNNs) are designed to further exploit spatial continuity and suppress noisy prediction. Experimental results on real HSI datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over several well-known methods in both visual appearance and classification accuracy.},

	abstract = {Author summary The predictions of biomolecular functions and properties from biomolecular structures are of fundamental importance in computational biophysics. The structural and biological complexities of biomolecules and their interactions hinder successful predictions. Machine learning has become an important tool for such predictions. Recent advances in deep learning architectures, particularly convolutional neural network (CNN), have profoundly impacted a number of disciplines, such as image classification and voice recognition. Though CNN can be directly applied to molecular sciences by using a three-dimensional (3D) image-like brute-force representation, it is computationally intractable when applied to large biomolecules and large datasets. We propose a topological strategy to significantly reduce the structural and biological complexity of biomolecules and provide an efficient topology based CNN architecture. Element-specific persistent homology, a new algebraic topology, has been developed to cast biomolecules in a multichannel image-like representation suitable for CNN. The power of the proposed topology based neural network (TopologyNet) is further enhanced by auxiliary descriptors and a multi-task deep learning architecture. It has been demonstrated that TopologyNet framework outperforms other methods in the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation induced protein stability changes.},

	abstract = {Existing methods for object instance segmentation require all training instances to be labeled with segmentation masks. This requirement makes it expensive to annotate new categories and has restricted instance segmentation models to {\textasciitilde}100 well-annotated classes. The goal of this paper is to propose a new partially supervised training paradigm, together with a novel weight transfer function, that enables training instance segmentation models over a large set of categories for which all have box annotations, but only a small fraction have mask annotations. These contributions allow us to train Mask R-CNN to detect and segment 3000 visual concepts using box annotations from the Visual Genome dataset and mask annotations from the 80 classes in the COCO dataset. We carefully evaluate our proposed approach in a controlled study on the COCO dataset. This work is a first step towards instance segmentation models that have broad comprehension of the visual world.},

	abstract = {We introduce YOLO9000, a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect over 9000 object categories. First we propose various improvements to the YOLO detection method, both novel and drawn from prior work. The improved model, YOLOv2, is state-of-the-art on standard detection tasks like PASCAL VOC and COCO. At 67 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 76.8 mAP on VOC 2007. At 40 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 78.6 mAP, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Faster RCNN with ResNet and SSD while still running significantly faster. Finally we propose a method to jointly train on object detection and classification. Using this method we train YOLO9000 simultaneously on the COCO detection dataset and the ImageNet classification dataset. Our joint training allows YOLO9000 to predict detections for object classes that don't have labelled detection data. We validate our approach on the ImageNet detection task. YOLO9000 gets 19.7 mAP on the ImageNet detection validation set despite only having detection data for 44 of the 200 classes. On the 156 classes not in COCO, YOLO9000 gets 16.0 mAP. But YOLO can detect more than just 200 classes; it predicts detections for more than 9000 different object categories. And it still runs in real-time.},

	doi = {10.1007/978-3-319-46448-0_2},
	abstract = {We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. Our SSD model is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stage and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has comparable accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy, even with a smaller input image size. For \$300{\textbackslash}times 300\$ input, SSD achieves 72.1\% mAP on VOC2007 test at 58 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for \$500{\textbackslash}times 500\$ input, SSD achieves 75.1\% mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model.

	abstract = {Obtaining models that capture imaging markers relevant for disease progression and treatment monitoring is challenging. Models are typically based on large amounts of data with annotated examples of known markers aiming at automating detection. High annotation effort and the limitation to a vocabulary of known markers limit the power of such approaches. Here, we perform unsupervised learning to identify anomalies in imaging data as candidates for markers. We propose AnoGAN, a deep convolutional generative adversarial network to learn a manifold of normal anatomical variability, accompanying a novel anomaly scoring scheme based on the mapping from image space to a latent space. Applied to new data, the model labels anomalies, and scores image patches indicating their fit into the learned distribution. Results on optical coherence tomography images of the retina demonstrate that the approach correctly identifies anomalous images, such as images containing retinal fluid or hyperreflective foci.},

However, dense prediction and image classification are structurally different. In this work, we develop a new convolutional network module that is specifically designed for dense prediction. The presented module uses dilated convolutions to systematically aggregate multi-scale contextual information without losing resolution. The architecture is based on the fact that dilated convolutions support exponential expansion of the receptive field without loss of resolution or coverage. We show that the presented context module increases the accuracy of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation systems. In addition, we examine the adaptation of image classification networks to dense prediction and show that simplifying the adapted network can increase accuracy.},

	abstract = {With the rise in whole slide scanner technology, large numbers of tissue slides are being scanned and represented and archived digitally. While digital pathology has substantial implications for telepathology, second opinions, and education there are also huge research opportunities in image computing with this new source of “big data”. It is well known that there is fundamental prognostic data embedded in pathology images. The ability to mine “sub-visual” image features from digital pathology slide images, features that may not be visually discernible by a pathologist, offers the opportunity for better quantitative modeling of disease appearance and hence possibly improved prediction of disease aggressiveness and patient outcome. However the compelling opportunities in precision medicine offered by big digital pathology data come with their own set of computational challenges. Image analysis and computer assisted detection and diagnosis tools previously developed in the context of radiographic images are woefully inadequate to deal with the data density in high resolution digitized whole slide images. Additionally there has been recent substantial interest in combining and fusing radiologic imaging and proteomics and genomics based measurements with features extracted from digital pathology images for better prognostic prediction of disease aggressiveness and patient outcome. Again there is a paucity of powerful tools for combining disease specific features that manifest across multiple different length scales. The purpose of this review is to discuss developments in computational image analysis tools for predictive modeling of digital pathology images from a detection, segmentation, feature extraction, and tissue classification perspective. We discuss the emergence of new handcrafted feature approaches for improved predictive modeling of tissue appearance and also review the emergence of deep learning schemes for both object detection and tissue classification. We also briefly review some of the state of the art in fusion of radiology and pathology images and also combining digital pathology derived image measurements with molecular “omics” features for better predictive modeling. The review ends with a brief discussion of some of the technical and computational challenges to be overcome and reflects on future opportunities for the quantitation of histopathology.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a method for machine (computer) assessment of the quality of a retinal image. The method provides an over-all quantitative and objective measure using a quality index Q. The Q of a retinal image is calculated by the convolution of a template intensity histogram obtained from a set of typically good retinal images and the intensity histogram of the retinal image. After normalization, the Q has a maximum value of 1, indicating excellent quality, and a minimum value of 0, indicating bad quality. The paper also presents several application examples of Q in image enhancement. It is shown that the use of Q can help computer scientists evaluate the suitability and effectiveness of image enhancement methods, both quantitatively and objectively. It can further help computer scientists improve retinal image quality on a more scientific basis. Additionally, this machine image quality measure can also help physicians make medical diagnosis with more certainty and higher accuracy. Finally, it should be noted that although retinal images are used in this study, the methodology is applicable to the image quality assessment and enhancement of other types of medical images.},

Objective and quantitative assessment of quality for the acquired images is essential for manual, computer-aided and fully automatic diagnosis. In this paper, we present a no-reference quality metric to quantify image noise and blur and its application to fundus image quality assessment. The proposed metric takes the vessel tree visible on the retina as guidance to determine an image quality score. In our experiments, the performance of this approach is demonstrated by correlation analysis with the established full-reference metrics peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM). We found a Spearman rank correlation for PSNR and SSIM of 0.89 and 0.91. For real data, our metric correlates reasonable to a human observer, indicating high agreement to human visual perception.},

Retinal image quality grading assesses whether the quality of the image is sufficient to allow diagnostic procedures to be applied. Automated quality analysis is an important preprocessing step in algorithmic diagnosis, as it is necessary to ensure that images are sufficiently clear to allow pathologies to be visible. The algorithm is based on standard recommendations for quality analysis by human screeners, examining the clarity of retinal vessels within the macula region. An evaluation against a reference standard data-set is given; it is shown that the algorithm's performance correlates closely with that of clinicians manually grading image quality.},

	abstract = {Sufficient image quality is a necessary prerequisite for reliable automatic detection systems in several healthcare environments. Specifically for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) detection, poor quality fund us makes more difficult the analysis of discontinuities that characterize lesions, as well as to generate evidence that can incorrectly diagnose the presence of anomalies. Several methods have been applied for classification of image quality and recently, have shown satisfactory results. However, most of the authors have focused only on the visibility of blood vessels through detection of blurring. Furthermore, these studies frequently only used fund us images from specific cameras which are not validated on datasets obtained from different retinographers. In this paper, we propose an approach to verify essential requirements of retinal image quality for DR screening: field definition and blur detection. The methods were developed and validated on two large, representative datasets collected by different cameras. The first dataset comprises 5,776 images and the second, 920 images. For field definition, the method yields a performance close to optimal with an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) of 96.0\%. For blur detection, the method achieves an area under the ROC curve of 95.5\%.},

	abstract = {Morphological changes in the retinal vascular network are associated with future risk of many systemic and vascular diseases. However, uncertainty over the presence and nature of some of these associations exists. Analysis of data from large population based studies will help to resolve these uncertainties. The QUARTZ (QUantitative Analysis of Retinal vessel Topology and siZe) retinal image analysis system allows automated processing of large numbers of retinal images. However, an image quality assessment module is needed to achieve full automation. In this paper, we propose such an algorithm, which uses the segmented vessel map to determine the suitability of retinal images for use in the creation of vessel morphometric data suitable for epidemiological studies. This includes an effective 3-dimensional feature set and support vector machine classification. A random subset of 800 retinal images from UK Biobank (a large prospective study of 500,000 middle aged adults; where 68,151 underwent retinal imaging) was used to examine the performance of the image quality algorithm. The algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 95.33\% and a specificity of 91.13\% for the detection of inadequate images. The strong performance of this image quality algorithm will make rapid automated analysis of vascular morphometry feasible on the entire UK Biobank dataset (and other large retinal datasets), with minimal operator involvement, and at low cost.},

It allows to visualize and interpret pathologic cell and tissue samples in high-resolution images and with the help of computer tools. This opens the possibility to develop image analysis methods that help pathologists and support their image descriptions (i.e., staging, grading) with objective quantification of image features. Numerous detection, classification and segmentation algorithms of the underlying tissue primitives in histopathology images have been proposed in this respect. To better select the most suitable algorithms for histopathology tasks, biomedical image analysis challenges have evaluated and compared both traditional feature extraction with machine learning and deep learning techniques. This chapter provides an overview of methods addressing the analysis of histopathology images, as well as a brief description of the tasks they aim to solve.

They explore all paths from a defined class, and filter them with a length criterion. However, most paths are redundant, making the process generally slow. Parsimonious path openings and closings are introduced in this paper to solve this problem. These operators only consider a subset of the paths considered by classical path openings, thus achieving a substantial speed-up, while obtaining similar results. In addition, a recently introduced 1D opening algorithm is applied along each selected path. Its complexity is linear with respect to the number of pixels, independent of the size of the opening. Furthermore, it is fast for any input data accuracy (integer or floating point) and works in stream. Parsimonious path openings are also extended to incomplete paths, i.e., paths containing gaps. Noise-corrupted paths can thus be processed with the same approach and complexity. These parsimonious operators achieve a several orders of magnitude speed-up. Examples are shown for incomplete path openings, where computing times are brought from minutes to tens of milliseconds, while obtaining similar results.},

High performance is critical in adoption of such systems, which generally rely on training with a wide variety of annotated data. Availability of such varied annotated data in medical imaging is very scarce. Synthetic data generation is a promising solution to address this problem. We propose a novel method, based on generative adversarial networks (GAN), to generate images with lesions such that the overall severity level can be controlled. We demonstrate the reliability of the generated synthetic images independently as well as by training a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system with the generated data. We showcase this approach for heamorrhage detection in retinal images with 4 levels of severity. Quantitative assessment results show that the generated synthetic images are very close to the real data. Haemorrhage detection was found to improve with inclusion of synthetic data in the training set with improvements in sensitivity ranging from 20\% to 27\% over training with just expert marked data.},

Separation of SC layer, extraction of patches from the layer followed by classification of patches with respect to presence or absence of neutrophils form the basis of the overall approach which is effected through an integration of a U-Net based segmentation network and a capsule network for classification. The novel design of the present capsule net leads to a drastic reduction in the number of parameters without any noticeable compromise in the overall performance. The research further addresses the challenge of dealing with Mega-pixel images (in 10X) vis-à-vis Giga-pixel ones (in 40X).

	abstract = {Rectified activation units (rectifiers) are essential for state-of-the-art neural networks. In this work, we study rectifier neural networks for image classification from two aspects. First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on our PReLU networks (PReLU-nets), we achieve 4.94\% top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26\% relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66\%). To our knowledge, our result is the first to surpass human-level performance (5.1\%, Russakovsky et al.) on this visual recognition challenge.},

	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are well known for producing state-of-the-art recognizers for document processing [1]. However, they can be difficult to implement and are usually slower than traditional multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We present three novel approaches to speeding up CNNs: a) unrolling convolution, b) using BLAS (basic linear algebra subroutines), and c) using GPUs (graphic processing units). Unrolled convolution converts the processing in each convolutional layer (both forward-propagation and back-propagation) into a matrix-matrix product. The matrix-matrix product representation of CNNs makes their implementation as easy as MLPs. BLAS is used to efficiently compute matrix products on the CPU. We also present a pixel shader based GPU implementation of CNNs. Results on character recognition problems indicate that unrolled convolution with BLAS produces a dramatic 2.4X−3.0X speedup. The GPU implementation is even faster and produces a 3.1X−4.1X speedup.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

This study had institutional review board approval and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. A dataset of volumetric structural MR images of the proximal femur from 86 subjects were manually-segmented by an expert. We performed experiments by training two different CNN architectures with multiple number of initial feature maps, layers and dilation rates, and tested their segmentation performance against the gold standard of manual segmentations using four-fold cross-validation. Automatic segmentation of the proximal femur using CNNs achieved a high dice similarity score of 0.95 ± 0.02 with precision = 0.95 ± 0.02, and recall = 0.95 ± 0.03. The high segmentation accuracy provided by CNNs has the potential to help bring the use of structural MRI measurements of bone quality into clinical practice for management of osteoporosis.},

Here we explore ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21.2\% top-1 and 5.6\% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters.

The presented work has been undertaken in the framework of the TeleOphta project, whose main objective is to automatically detect normal exams in a tele-ophthalmology network, thus reducing the burden on the readers. A new clinical database, e-ophtha EX, containing precisely manually contoured exudates, is introduced. As opposed to previously available databases, e-ophtha EX is very heterogeneous. It contains images gathered within the OPHDIAT telemedicine network for diabetic retinopathy screening. Image definition, quality, as well as patients condition or the retinograph used for the acquisition, for example, are subject to important changes between different examinations. The proposed exudate detection method has been designed for this complex situation. We propose new preprocessing methods, which perform not only normalization and denoising tasks, but also detect reflections and artifacts in the image. A new candidates segmentation method, based on mathematical morphology, is proposed. These candidates are characterized using classical features, but also novel contextual features. Finally, a random forest algorithm is used to detect the exudates among the candidates. The method has been validated on the e-ophtha EX database, obtaining an AUC of 0.95. It has been also validated on other databases, obtaining an AUC between 0.93 and 0.95, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.},

In this paper, we propose an approach for automatically segmenting the walls of retinal arteries in the images acquired with this technology. The walls are modeled as four curves approximately parallel to a previously detected reference line located near the vessel center (axial reflection). These curves are first initialized using a tracking procedure and then more accurately positioned using an active contour model embedding a parallelism constraint. We consider both healthy and pathological subjects in the same framework and show that the proposed method applies in all cases. Extensive experiments are also proposed, by analyzing the robustness of the axial reflections detection, the influence of the tracking parameters as well as the performance of the tracking and the active contour model. Noticeably, the results show a good robustness for detecting axial reflections and a moderate influence of the tracking parameters. Compared to a naive initialization, the active contour model coupled with the tracking also offers faster convergence and better accuracy while keeping an overall error smaller or very near the inter-physicians error.},

It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

We propose a new method to extract uniqueness-driven saliency based on the uniqueness of intensity and spatial distributions within the images. The main novelty of this new saliency feature is that it is powerful in the detection of different types of lesions in different types of images without the need of tuning parameters for different problems. To evaluate its effectiveness, we have applied our method to the detection lesions of retinal images. Four different types of lesions: exudate, hemorrhage, microaneurysms and leakage from 7 independent public retinal image datasets of diabetic retinopathy and malarial retinopathy, were studied and the experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Nuclei segmentation is a fundamental task that is critical for various computational pathology applications including nuclei morphology analysis, cell type classification, and cancer grading. Conventional vision-based methods for nuclei segmentation struggle in challenging cases and deep learning approaches have proven to be more robust and generalizable. However, CNNs require large amounts of labeled histopathology data. Moreover, conventional CNN-based approaches lack structured prediction capabilities which are required to distinguish overlapping and clumped nuclei. Here, we present an approach to nuclei segmentation that overcomes these challenges by utilizing a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) trained with synthetic and real data. We generate a large dataset of H\&E training images with perfect nuclei segmentation labels using an unpaired GAN framework. This synthetic data along with real histopathology data from six different organs are used to train a conditional GAN with spectral normalization and gradient penalty for nuclei segmentation. This adversarial regression framework enforces higher order consistency when compared to conventional CNN models. We demonstrate that this nuclei segmentation approach generalizes across different organs, sites, patients and disease states, and outperforms conventional approaches, especially in isolating individual and overlapping nuclei.},

	abstract = {Hematoxylin and Eosin stained histopathology image analysis is essential for the diagnosis and study of complicated diseases such as cancer. Existing state-of-the-art approaches demand extensive amount of supervised training data from trained pathologists. In this work we synthesize in an unsupervised manner, large histopathology image datasets, suitable for supervised training tasks. We propose a unified pipeline that: a) generates a set of initial synthetic histopathology images with paired information about the nuclei such as segmentation masks; b) refines the initial synthetic images through a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to reference styles; c) trains a task-specific CNN and boosts the performance of the task-specific CNN with on-the-fly generated adversarial examples. Our main contribution is that the synthetic images are not only realistic, but also representative (in reference styles) and relatively challenging for training task-specific CNNs. We test our method for nucleus segmentation using images from four cancer types. When no supervised data exists for a cancer type, our method without supervision cost significantly outperforms supervised methods which perform across-cancer generalization. Even when supervised data exists for all cancer types, our approach without supervision cost performs better than supervised methods.},

	abstract = {State-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms generally consist of at least two successive and distinct computations: a boundary detection process that uses local image information to classify image locations as boundaries between objects, followed by a pixel grouping step such as watershed or connected components that clusters pixels into segments. Prior work has varied the complexity and approach employed in these two steps, including the incorporation of multi-layer neural networks to perform boundary prediction, and the use of global optimizations during pixel clustering. We propose a unified and end-to-end trainable machine learning approach, flood-filling networks, in which a recurrent 3d convolutional network directly produces individual segments from a raw image. The proposed approach robustly segments images with an unknown and variable number of objects as well as highly variable object sizes. We demonstrate the approach on a challenging 3d image segmentation task, connectomic reconstruction from volume electron microscopy data, on which flood-filling neural networks substantially improve accuracy over other state-of-the-art methods. The proposed approach can replace complex multi-step segmentation pipelines with a single neural network that is learned end-to-end.},

	abstract = {In radiotherapy treatment planning, manual annotation of organs-at-risk and target volumes is a difficult and time-consuming task, prone to intra and inter-observer variabilities. Deep learning networks (DLNs) are gaining worldwide attention to automate such annotative tasks because of their ability to capture data hierarchy. However, for better performance DLNs require large number of data samples whereas annotated medical data is scarce. To remedy this, data augmentation is used to increase the training data for DLNs that enables robust learning by incorporating spatial/translational invariance into the training phase. Importantly, performance of DLNs is highly dependent on the ground truth (GT) quality: if manual annotation is not accurate enough, the network cannot learn better than the annotated example. This highlights the need to compensate for possibly insufficient GT quality using augmentation, i.e., by providing more GTs per image, in order to improve performance of DLNs. In this work, small random alterations were applied to GT and each altered GT was considered as an additional annotation. Contour augmentation was used to train a dilated U-Net in multiple GTs per image setting, which was tested on a pelvic CT dataset acquired from 67 patients to segment bladder and rectum in a multi-class segmentation setting. By using contour augmentation (coupled with data augmentation), the network learnt better than with data augmentation only, as it was able to correct slightly offset contours in GT. The segmentation results produced were quantified using spatial overlap, distance-based and probabilistic measures. The Dice score for bladder and rectum are reported as 0.88\&plusmn;0.19 and 0.89\&plusmn;0.04, whereas the average symmetric surface distance are 0.22 \&plusmn; 0.09 mm and 0.09 \&plusmn; 0.05 mm, respectively.},

We extend FCNs by adding short skip connections, that are similar to the ones introduced in residual networks, in order to build very deep FCNs (of hundreds of layers). A review of the gradient flow confirms that for a very deep FCN it is beneficial to have both long and short skip connections. Finally, we show that a very deep FCN can achieve near-to-state-of-the-art results on the EM dataset without any further post-processing.},

	abstract = {State-of-the-art approaches for semantic image segmentation are built on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The typical segmentation architecture is composed of (a) a downsampling path responsible for extracting coarse semantic features, followed by (b) an upsampling path trained to recover the input image resolution at the output of the model and, optionally, (c) a post-processing module (e.g. Conditional Random Fields) to refine the model predictions. Recently, a new CNN architecture, Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), has shown excellent results on image classification tasks. The idea of DenseNets is based on the observation that if each layer is directly connected to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion then the network will be more accurate and easier to train. In this paper, we extend DenseNets to deal with the problem of semantic segmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art results on urban scene benchmark datasets such as CamVid and Gatech, without any further post-processing module nor pretraining. Moreover, due to smart construction of the model, our approach has much less parameters than currently published best entries for these datasets.

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build "fully convolutional" networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a novel architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20\% relative improvement to 62.2\% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes one third of a second for a typical image.},

Our CNN is trained end-to-end on MRI volumes depicting prostate, and learns to predict segmentation for the whole volume at once. We introduce a novel objective function, that we optimise during training, based on Dice coefficient. In this way we can deal with situations where there is a strong imbalance between the number of foreground and background voxels. To cope with the limited number of annotated volumes available for training, we augment the data applying random non-linear transformations and histogram matching.

Among other characteristics, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are known because of their ability to learn highly discriminative features from raw pixel intensities.MethodsIn this paper, we employed five different ImageNet-trained models (VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, ResNet50 and Xception) for automatic glaucoma assessment using fundus images. Results from an extensive validation using cross-validation and cross-testing strategies were compared with previous works in the literature.ResultsUsing five public databases (1707 images), an average AUC of 0.9605 with a 95\% confidence interval of 95.92–97.07\%, an average specificity of 0.8580 and an average sensitivity of 0.9346 were obtained after using the Xception architecture, significantly improving the performance of other state-of-the-art works. Moreover, a new clinical database, ACRIMA, has been made publicly available, containing 705 labelled images. It is composed of 396 glaucomatous images and 309 normal images, which means, the largest public database for glaucoma diagnosis. The high specificity and sensitivity obtained from the proposed approach are supported by an extensive validation using not only the cross-validation strategy but also the cross-testing validation on, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, all publicly available glaucoma-labelled databases.ConclusionsThese results suggest that using ImageNet-trained models is a robust alternative for automatic glaucoma screening system. All images, CNN weights and software used to fine-tune and test the five CNNs are publicly available, which could be used as a testbed for further comparisons.},

	abstract = {We address the problem of detecting anomalies in images, specifically that of detecting regions characterized by structures that do not conform those of normal images. In the proposed approach we exploit convolutional sparse models to learn a dictionary of filters from a training set of normal images. These filters capture the structure of normal images and are leveraged to quantitatively assess whether regions of a test image are normal or anomalous. Each test image is at first encoded with respect to the learned dictionary, yielding sparse coefficient maps, and then analyzed by computing indicator vectors that assess the conformance of local image regions with the learned filters. Anomalies are then detected by identifying outliers in these indicators. Our experiments demonstrate that a convolutional sparse model provides better anomaly-detection performance than an equivalent method based on standard patch-based sparsity. Most importantly, our results highlight that monitoring the local group sparsity, namely the spread of nonzero coefficients across different maps, is essential for detecting anomalous regions.},

This may be seen as “one-class classification”, in which a model is constructed to describe “normal” training data. The novelty detection approach is typically used when the quantity of available “abnormal” data is insufficient to construct explicit models for non-normal classes. Application includes inference in datasets from critical systems, where the quantity of available normal data is very large, such that “normality” may be accurately modelled. In this review we aim to provide an updated and structured investigation of novelty detection research papers that have appeared in the machine learning literature during the last decade.},

	abstract = {Mathematical morphological methods have successfully been applied to filter out (emphasize or remove) different structures of an image. However, it is argued that these methods could be suitable for the task only if the type and order of the filter(s) as well as the shape and size of operator kernel are designed properly. Thus the existing filtering operators are problem (instance) specific and are designed by the domain experts. In this work we propose a morphological network that emulates classical morphological filtering consisting of a series of erosion and dilation operators with trainable structuring elements. We evaluate the proposed network for image de-raining task where the SSIM and mean absolute error (MAE) loss corresponding to predicted and ground-truth clean image is back-propagated through the network to train the structuring elements. We observe that a single morphological network can de-rain an image with any arbitrary shaped rain-droplets and achieves similar performance with the contemporary CNNs for this task with a fraction of trainable parameters (network size). The proposed morphological network (MorphoN) is not designed specifically for de-raining and can readily be applied to similar filtering/noise cleaning tasks.

	doi = {10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587510},
	abstract = {We present a novel framework for learning patterns of motion and sizes of objects in static camera surveillance. The proposed method provides a new higher-level layer to the traditional surveillance pipeline for anomalous event detection and scene model feedback. Pixel level probability density functions (pdfs) of appearance have been used for background modelling in the past, but modelling pixel level pdfs of object speed and size from the tracks is novel. Each pdf is modelled as a multivariate Gaussian mixture model (GMM) of the motion (destination location \& transition time) and the size (width \& height) parameters of the objects at that location. Output of the tracking module is used to perform unsupervised EM-based learning of every GMM. We have successfully used the proposed scene model to detect local as well as global anomalies in object tracks. We also show the use of this scene model to improve object detection through pixel-level parameter feedback of the minimum object size and background learning rate. Most object path modelling approaches first cluster the tracks into major paths in the scene, which can be a source of error. We avoid this by building local pdfs that capture a variety of tracks which are passing through them. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of actual surveillance videos proved the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection is a classical problem in computer vision, namely the determination of the normal from the abnormal when datasets are highly biased towards one class (normal) due to the insufficient sample size of the other class (abnormal). While this can be addressed as a supervised learning problem, a significantly more challenging problem is that of detecting the unknown/unseen anomaly case that takes us instead into the space of a one-class, semi-supervised learning paradigm. We introduce such a novel anomaly detection model, by using a conditional generative adversarial network that jointly learns the generation of high-dimensional image space and the inference of latent space. Employing encoder-decoder-encoder sub-networks in the generator network enables the model to map the input image to a lower dimension vector, which is then used to reconstruct the generated output image. The use of the additional encoder network maps this generated image to its latent representation. Minimizing the distance between these images and the latent vectors during training aids in learning the data distribution for the normal samples. As a result, a larger distance metric from this learned data distribution at inference time is indicative of an outlier from that distribution—an anomaly. Experimentation over several benchmark datasets, from varying domains, shows the model efficacy and superiority over previous state-of-the-art approaches.},
