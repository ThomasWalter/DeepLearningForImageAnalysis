\begin{frame}{Differentiable programming}

\begin{block}{Definition}
  Differentiable programming is an algorithmic framework where differentiable operators are combined together to build complex systems. The parameters of the system can then be optimized via gradient descent thanks to \alert{back-propagation}.
\end{block}

The object of study of differential programming are \emph{computational graphs}.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Computational graph}

\begin{block}{Definition}
  A computational graph is a direct acyclic graph such that:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A node is a mathematical operator
  \item To each edge is associated a value (scalar, vector, matrix, tensor, $\ldots$)
  \item Each node can compute the values of its output edges from the values of its input edges
  \end{itemize}
\end{block}

Computing a \emph{forward pass} through the graph means choosing its input values, and then progressively computing the values of all edges.


\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \[

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Setting the parameters of the computational graph}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item A \alert{computational graph} is used to compute a transformation between its inputs and outputs.
  \item In order to set its parameters, a loss function is chosen. Its minimization via gradient descent allows to set the parameters of the model.


    %% \alert{loss} function $\loss$, which depends on the input of the system $\X$ and its parameters $\param = \{\param_1, \ldots, \param_q\}$.

      \begin{block}{Definition: gradient}
        Let $\loss $ be a derivable function from $\R^n$ into $\R$. Its gradient $\nabla\loss$ is:
        \[
        \nabla_{\param} \loss (\param) =
        \begin{pmatrix}
          \frac{\partial \loss}{\partial \param_1}(\param)\\
          \vdots \\
          \frac{\partial \loss}{\partial \param_n}(\param)
        \end{pmatrix}
        \]

      \end{block}
    \end{column}
  \end{columns}


\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Gradient descent applied to computational graphs}

  In the case of computational graphs, the loss $\loss$ depends on each parameter $\param_i$ via the composition of several functions. In order to compute the gradient $\nabla_{\param}\loss$ we will make extensive use of the chain rule theorem.

  \begin{block}{Chain rule theorem}
    Let $f_1$ and $f_2$ be two differentiable real functions ($\R \rightarrow \R$). Then for all $x$ in $\R$:   :
    \[
     (f_2 \circ f_1)'(x) = f_2'(f_1(x)).f_1'(x)
    \]
  \end{block}


\begin{block}{Leibniz notation}
  Let us introduce variables $x$, $y$ and $z$:
  \[x \xrightarrow{f_1} y \xrightarrow{f_2} z\]

  Then:
  \[\dv{z}{x} = \dv{z}{y} \cdot \dv{y}{x} \]

\end{block}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{The backpropagation algorithm}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item The backpropagation algorithm is used in a computational graph to efficiently compute the partial derivatives of the loss with respect to each parameter of the network.
  \item One can trace the origins of the method to the sixties
  \item It was first applied to NN in the eighties \cite{werbos_applications_1982, lecun_procedure_1985}
  \end{itemize}


\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{The backpropagation algorithm: intuition}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Given a computational graph, the main idea is to compute the local partial derivatives during a forward pass
    \item Then, during a backward pass, the partial derivatives of the loss with respect to each parameter is computed
  \end{itemize}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Machine Learning: basic definitions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Machine Learning aims at predicting some output $y$ from an input (or measurement) $x$:
	\begin{equation}
	y = f(x)
	\end{equation}
	\item In this formulation, Machine Learning aims at finding (learning) $f$ from available data.
	\item The data that is used to learn $f$ is called \textbf{training set}, denoted by $\X$.
	\item In this general formulation, there is no particular limitation as to the mathematical nature of $x$ and $y$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A simple example: polynomial curve fitting\footnote{Example adapted from \cite{Bishop2006}}}
\begin{figure}[htb]
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{../graphics/sample_from_sin.png}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
	\item From a set of measured points $(x_i, y_i)$ (red), we would like to build a model to predict the value $y$ for any given $x$.
	\item The true function is $g(x)=\sin (x)$ (displayed in blue).
	\item The measurements $y_i$ are noisy outputs of that function, i.e.
	\begin{equation}
	y_i = \sin (x_i) + \epsilon \; , \;\;\; \;\;\; \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,0.2)
	\end{equation}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A simple example: polynomial curve fitting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We use the following polynomial model:
	\begin{eqnarray}
	f(x) &=& a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \ldots + a_m x^m \nonumber \\
	&=& \param^T \featmap (x)
	\end{eqnarray}
	\item Parameter vector: $\param = (a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_m)^T$
	\item Here, the initial measurement $x$ is a scalar. In our model, we map $x$ to a higher dimensional space:
	\begin{eqnarray}
		\featmap : \mathbb{R}^{\nfeatures} &\rightarrow & \mathbb{R}^Q \nonumber \\
		x &\rightarrow & \featmap (x) = (1, x, x^2, \ldots, x^m)^T
	\end{eqnarray}
	\item The model is linear in the parameters $\theta$ and linear in $\featmap$, but for $m>1$, the model is not linear in $x$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A simple example: polynomial curve fitting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item One classical approach is to minimize the least squared error between measured and predicted values:
	\begin{eqnarray}
		\min_{\param} \loss(\param) &=& \min_{\param} \sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - f(x_i))^2 \nonumber \\
		&=& \min_{\param} \sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \param^T \featmap (x_i))^2
	\end{eqnarray}
	\item This can be achieved by setting the gradient with respect to $\param$ to zero:
	\begin{equation}
		\nabla_{\param} \loss = (\frac{\partial \loss}{\partial a_0}, \frac{\partial \loss}{\partial a_1}, \ldots, \frac{\partial \loss}{\partial a_m} )^T = 0
	\end{equation}
	\item Unlike most optimization problems in this course, this leads to an analytical solution for $\param$. This is known as \textbf{linear regression}. For more details, we refer to \cite{Hastie2009}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{column}{.2\textwidth}
$\| \param \|^2 = 0.67$
\end{column}
\end{columns}
For $m=1$, the model is linear in its inputs. The solution is not capable of modeling the measured data points; we get a poor approximation of the original function. The family of functions we have used was not complex enough to model the true data distribution. We also speak of \textbf{underfitting}.

\begin{column}{.2\textwidth}
$\| \param \|^2 = 1.72$
\end{column}
\end{columns}
For $m=3$, we obtain a solution that seems to be quite right: it is sufficiently complex to model the true data distribution, but not too complex to model the small variations which are due to noise.

\end{figure}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{.2\textwidth}
$\| \param \|^2 \approx 10^7$
\end{column}
\end{columns}
For $m=11$, we obtain a solution that has zero error (the function passes through every point of the training set). But the coefficients with large absolute values that cancel each other precisely on the training points lead to a highly unstable function. We speak of \textbf{overfitting} and \textbf{poor generalization}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Overfitting and underfitting}

\end{figure}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{.2\textwidth}
$\| \param \|^2 = 5647$
\end{column}
\end{columns}
One way of reducing overfitting is to increase the number of samples. Even if the function is complex, it cannot be ‚Äútoo wild‚Äù, as it has to find a compromise between many training samples. This however implies the annotation (or measurement) of more samples.

Another way of preventing overfitting without increasing the number of samples, is to add a penalization term in the optimization procedure. This is also known as \textbf{regularization}:
\begin{equation}
	\loss = \sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \param^T \featmap (x_i))^2 + \lambda \| \param \|^2

\item Note that we often abusively say \emph{invariant} to translation instead of \emph{equivariant} to translation.

  \begin{block}{Definition: image segmentation}
    Let $I$ be an image defined on $D$. A segmentation of $I$ is a partition of $D$. In practice the regions of the segmentation should correspond to the objects in $I$, which is application dependant.

\begin{frame}{Conclusion on loss functions}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Use the Jaccard loss as base line for segmentation problems.
  \item Note that these losses compute their values pixel-wise: they do not take into account any structure (for example, continuity).
  \item Working on specific losses enforcing structure = interesting research path.

  \begin {itemize}
  \item Progress in image segmentation since 2012 has been enormous
  \item Several complex problems have now satisfactory solutions
  \item Training can be a problem (large annotated databases, difficult optimization)
  \item There are still challenges ahead...
